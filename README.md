# Multilingual lexical simplification
Lexical simplification aims at replacing single words with their simpler synonyms. The MLSP shared tasks provides resources for lexical simplification across many languages. In this project, we use these resources to build our own pipelines. The project gives great opportunities to contribute to the latest research problems with your own ideas!

## Students
