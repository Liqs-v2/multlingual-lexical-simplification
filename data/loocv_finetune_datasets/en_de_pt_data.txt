Aktion gegen Plastik-Müll
Viele Lebens-Mittel im Supermarkt sind in Plastik verpackt.
Das ist oft unnötig.
In Berlin gab es dagegen eine Aktion.
In einem Supermarkt in Berlin hat eine Aktion stattgefunden:
Eine Gruppe von Menschen hat dort eingekauft.
Sie hat Produkte in ihren Einkaufs-Wagen gepackt und bezahlt.
Sie hat dann alle Produkte aus dem Einkaufs-Wagen geräumt und im Supermarkt auf den Boden gelegt.
Warum hat die Gruppe das gemacht ?
Um den Plastik-Müll von den Produkten zu entfernen.
Die Menschen haben zum Beispiel: • die Plastik-Folie von einer Gurke abgezogen • Gummi-Bärchen aus der Tüte geholt • Milch aus dem Tetra-Pack gegossen
Sie haben die Produkte dann umgefüllt.
Zum Beispiel in Stoffbeutel, Tupper-Dosen oder Glas-Flaschen.
Die Menschen haben die Plastik-Verpackungen in ihrem Einkaufs-Wagen liegen gelassen.
Denn ein Super-Markt muss einen Teil von den Plastik-Verpackungen wieder zurücknehmen.
Warum haben die Menschen die Aktion gemacht ?
Die Aktion heißt " Plastik-Attacke ".
Die Aktion hat es in anderen Städten in anderen Ländern schon öfter gegeben.
Zum Beispiel in den Städten Brüssel, Amsterdam und Oslo.
Mit der Aktion in Berlin hat es " Plastik-Attacke " das 1. Mal in Deutschland gegeben.
Mitglieder von dem Verband BUND-Jugend haben die Aktion in Berlin organisiert.
BUND ist die Abkürzung für Bund für Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland.
Der Verband BUND-Jugend setzt sich für Umwelt-Schutz ein.
Die Aktion " Plastik-Attacke " soll zeigen: Es gibt zu viele Plastik-Verpackungen.
Dadurch gibt es zu viel Plastik-Müll.
Die Aktion " Plastik-Attacke " soll Supermärkte dazu bringen, weniger Plastik-Verpackungen anzubieten.
Warum ist Plastik-Müll schlecht ?
Plastik-Müll verschmutzt die Umwelt.
In Deutschland gibt es jedes Jahr 5 Millionen Tonnen Plastik-Müll.
Die BUND-Jugend sagt: Weniger als die Hälfte von dem Plastik-Müll wird weiter verarbeitet und wieder verwendet.
Der Großteil von dem Plastik-Müll wird verbrannt.
Das ist schlecht für das Klima.
Ein weiterer Teil von dem Plastik-Müll landet über Umwege im Meer.
Wale, Delfine, Schildkröten und Fische verwechseln den Plastik-Müll dann oft mit Nahrung.
Sie fressen den Plastik-Müll und sterben oft daran.
Wie reagieren Menschen auf die Aktionen BUND-Jugend ?
Im Berliner Supermarkt war es zum Beispiel so:
Manche Menschen haben nicht den Sinn von einer Aktion wie " Plastik-Attacke " verstanden.
Aber manche Menschen fanden die Aktionen gut.
Manche Menschen haben bei " Plastik-Attacke " im Berliner Supermarkt sogar spontan mitgemacht.
Inklusion im Fußball
Christian Specht malt Bilder zur WM.
Diesmal geht es um das Thema Inklusion.
Bei dem Bild geht es um Menschen mit Behinderungen im Fußball.
Ich finde: Menschen mit Behinderungen sollen nicht ausgeschlossen werden.
Sie sollen bei der WM mitmachen.
Menschen mit und ohne Behinderung sollen in einer Mannschaft spielen.
Dann gibt es weniger Berührungs-Ängste im Sport und bei Fans.
Was mir nicht so gut gefällt:
Eine getrennt Veranstaltung wie die Paralympics.
Die Olympischen Spiele für Menschen mit Behinderungen.
Auch da wurde schon besprochen: Sollen Olympische Spiele und Paralympics zusammen stattfinden ?
Das fände ich gut.
Dann schauen es vielleicht mehr Menschen.
AfD zu Menschen mit Behinderungen
Die Partei AfD hat im Bundestag eine Anfrage gestellt.
Darin geht es um Menschen mit Behinderungen.
Viele Menschen finden die Anfrage schlecht.
Die Partei AfD hat eine Anfrage an die Bundes-Regierung gestellt.
Was ist eine Anfrage ?
In einer Anfrage erfragen Parteien im Bundestag bestimmte Zahlen und Daten.
Zum Beispiel Bevölkerungs-Zahlen.
Die Bundes-Regierung muss die Anfrage dann beantworten.
Sie muss der Partei die Zahlen mitteilen.
Was hat die AfD in ihrer Anfrage gefragt ?
Die AfD hat zum Beispiel gefragt: • Wie viele Menschen mit Behinderungen gibt es in Deutschland ? • Aus welchen Gründen haben diese Menschen eine Behinderung ? • Haben sie eine Behinderung, weil ihre Eltern miteinander verwandt sind ? • Sind die Eltern miteinander verwandt, weil sie einen Migrations-Hintergrund haben ?
Migrations-Hintergrund bedeutet: Ein Mensch kommt aus einem anderen Land.
Oder die Eltern oder Großeltern eines Menschen kommen aus einem anderen Land.
Warum ist die Anfrage von der AfD schlecht ?
Die Fragen von der AfD kann man so verstehen:
• Kann man eine Behinderung vermeiden ?
• Sind die Eltern von Menschen mit Behinderungen daran schuld ?
• Sind Menschen mit Migrations-Hintergrund daran schuld ?
Das würde zeigen: Die AfD sieht eine Behinderung als Problem.
Viele Menschen ärgern sich über die Anfrage von der AfD !
Vor allem Menschen und Verbände ärgern sich, die mit Menschen mit Behinderung arbeiten.
Und für ihre Rechte kämpfen.
Die taz hat mit Ulrich Schneider gesprochen.
Ulrich Schneider arbeitet für den Paritätischen Wohlfahrts-Verband.
Der Paritätische Wohlfahrts-Verband ist für soziale Aufgaben zuständig.
Zum Beispiel für die Arbeit mit Menschen mit Behinderungen.
Ulrich Schneider sagt: Die Anfrage von der AfD ist ein großes Problem.
Denn die AfD stellt mit ihrer Anfrage 2 Zusammenhänge her:
• zwischen Behinderung und verwandten Eltern
• zwischen Behinderung und Migration
Ulrich Schneider sagt: So ein Denken ist menschen-feindlich.
So ein Denken erinnert an den National-Sozialismus.
So ein Denken macht vielen Menschen Angst.
Wir müssen darüber reden.
Wir müssen aufklären.
Wir müssen uns gegen die AfD wehren.
Denn Menschen mit Behinderungen sind ein Teil der Gesellschaft.
Hühner müssen oft leiden
Hühner sind wichtig für die Lebensmittel-Industrie.
Aber sie werden oft sehr schlecht behandelt.
In vielen Lebensmitteln sind Eier.
Zum Beispiel in Nudeln.
Wo kommen diese Eier her ?
Sie kommen meistens von Hühnern auf sehr großen Bauernhöfen.
Oft leben dort viele Hühner zusammen in einem Stall.
Oft leben die Hühner dort in Gruppen in sehr kleinen Käfigen.
Das nennt man: Käfig-Haltung.
In Deutschland gibt es sehr wenig Käfig-Haltung.
Wie kommen die Eier aus Käfig-Haltung trotzdem in die Lebensmittel in deutschen Supermärkten ?
Ein Grund ist: In anderen Ländern gibt es viel mehr Käfig-Haltung.
Und Eier von Hühnern aus Käfig-Haltung sind billig.
Einige deutsche Hersteller kaufen deshalb Eier aus Käfig-Haltung.
Zum Beispiel Hersteller von Nudel-Produkten.
Eier in Produkten von " Birkel " und " 3 Glocken "
" Birkel " und " 3 Glocken " sind zwei deutsche Nudel-Hersteller.
Die beiden Nudel-Hersteller sagen: Wir verwenden Eier von frei laufenden Hühnern.
Den Hühnern geht es gut.
Viele Käufer von Lebensmitteln finden es wichtig, dass es den Hühnern gut geht.
Viele Käufer wollen, • dass die Hühner genug Platz haben, • dass die Hühner das richtige Futter bekommen.
Das nennt man auch: art-gerechte Haltung.
In Europa gibt es Regeln für eine art-gerechte Haltung.
Entdeckung vom Tierschutz-Verein " Peta "
Der Tierschutz-Verein " Peta " hat jetzt herausgefunden: Es ist falsch, was die Nudel-Hersteller sagen.
Es ist falsch, was " Birkel " und " 3 Glocken " sagen.
Der Tierschutz-Verein " Peta " sagt: " Birkel " und " 3 Glocken " benutzen nicht nur Eier von frei laufenden Hühnern.
Sie benutzen für ihre Produkte auch Eier aus Käfig-Haltung.
Sie benutzen Eier von Bauern in den Niederlanden und in Polen.
" Peta " hat sich diese Bauernhöfe angesehen.
" Peta " sagt: Den Hühnern geht es dort nicht gut.
Einige Hühner liegen tot herum.
Einige Hühner haben offene Wunden.
Einige Hühner haben zu wenig zu trinken.
Die Hühner können nicht auf dem Boden scharren und picken.
Die Hühner haben zu wenig Platz in den Käfigen.
Das ist keine art-gerechte Haltung.
Der Tierschutz-Verein " Peta " will dagegen kämpfen.
" Peta " will die Misshandlung von Hühnern stoppen.
" Peta " hat deshalb Bilder von den betroffenen Bauernhöfen veröffentlicht.
Und " Peta " hat eine Aktion gestartet.
Die Aktion heißt: " Mach dich eifrei ".
Bei der Aktion zeigt " Peta ": • dass wir keine Eier zum Leben brauchen • und wodurch wir Eier in Lebensmitteln ersetzen können.
" Peta " sagt: Wenn die Menschen keine Eier mehr essen, dann werden dafür keine Hühner mehr gequält.
Roboter in der Pflege
Forscher entwickeln Roboter für die Pflege von älteren Menschen.
Ist das eine gute Idee ?
In Deutschland gibt es immer mehr alte Menschen.
Warum ist das so ?
Die medizinische Versorgung wird immer besser.
Deshalb werden Menschen immer älter.
Immer mehr Menschen müssen im Alter gepflegt werden.
Gleichzeitig gibt es zu wenige Pflege-Kräfte in der Alten-Pflege.
Woran liegt das ?
Die Arbeit wird schlecht bezahlt.
Die Arbeit ist oft sehr stressig.
Die Arbeit von Pflege-Kräften bekommt wenig Anerkennung.
Es gibt also immer mehr alte Menschen und wenig Pflege-Kräfte.
Deshalb stellt sich diese Frage:
Wer soll die Pflege übernehmen ?
Ein Vorschlag von Forschern, Unternehmern und Politikern lautet: In der Alten-Pflege sollen Pflege-Roboter eingesetzt werden.
Forscher in vielen Ländern forschen an verschiedenen Pflege-Robotern.
Einige Pflege-Roboter können zum Beispiel: • schwer heben • Menschen waschen • Essen reichen • Dinge bringen • telefonieren
So sieht zum Beispiel ein Pflege-Roboter aus:
Sind Pflege-Roboter eine gute Lösung ?
Sollen sie in Zukunft ältere Menschen pflegen ?
Und was halten ältere Menschen davon ?
Wollen sie von Robotern gepflegt werden ?
Und was halten Pflege-Kräfte davon ?
Wollen sie mit Robotern zusammen-arbeiten ?
Die taz spricht darüber mit dem Pflege-Forscher Heiner Friesacher.
Heiner Friesacher sagt dazu: Roboter können nicht alle Aufgaben in der Pflege übernehmen.
Roboter sollen keine älteren Menschen waschen.
Und sie sollen älteren Menschen kein Essen anreichen.
Denn das sind keine einfachen Aufgaben.
Man braucht dafür viel Einfühlungs-Vermögen.
Pflege-Kräfte haben dieses Einfühlungs-Vermögen.
Sie kennen zum Beispiel das Tempo von den älteren Menschen.
Und sie können die körperliche Verfassung und die Gefühle von den älteren Menschen beachten.
Ein Roboter kann das nicht.
Sind Roboter in der Pflege also undenkbar ?
Soll es sie gar nicht geben ?
Heiner Friesacher sagt dazu: Roboter können keine Pflege-Kräfte ersetzen.
Roboter können aber Pflege-Kräfte unterstützen.
Sie können bei der Pflege die Aufgaben übernehmen, die nicht direkt mit Menschen zu tun haben.
Sie können zum Beispiel: • den Fernseher einschalten, • die Spülmaschine einräumen, • als Telefon dienen.
Wenn der Roboter diese Aufgaben übernimmt, haben Pflege-Kräfte mehr Zeit für die älteren Menschen.
Worauf muss man beim Einsatz von Robotern außerdem achten ?
Heiner Friesacher sagt dazu: Zum Beispiel ist die Sicherheit von persönlichen Informationen wichtig.
Die Roboter können filmen und Gespräche aufzeichnen.
Das sind persönliche Informationen über die Menschen.
Aber wer bekommt die Informationen ?
Und wie werden diese Informationen genutzt ?
Über diese und andere Themen müssen Forscher, Firmen und Politiker reden.
Sie müssen alle Beteiligen einbeziehen.
Sie müssen mit Pflege-Kräften, älteren Menschen und ihren Verwandten reden.
Denn Betroffene wissen am besten, wie Pflege funktioniert.
Sie können sagen, was ein Roboter können muss und wo der Roboter-Einsatz hilfreich ist.
Inklusive Musik in Berlin
Musik spielt eine große Rolle in Berlin.
Menschen mit Behinderungen wollen daran teilhaben.
Elektronische Musik gehört zu Berlin.
Bei vielen Partys in Berlin läuft elektronische Musik.
Viele Menschen tanzen gern zu elektronischer Musik.
Und viele Menschen machen selbst elektronische Musik.
Sie machen diese Musik in ihrer Freizeit oder als Beruf.
Menschen mit Behinderungen wollen teilhaben
Menschen mit Behinderungen machen auch Musik.
Aber für Menschen mit Behinderungen gibt es nur wenige Verbindungen mit elektronischer Musik.
Das bedeutet: Es gibt wenig Möglichkeiten zum Musik machen.
Und bei den Partys mit elektronischer Musik können Menschen mit Behinderungen oft nicht mitfeiern.
Die Partys fangen oft zu spät an.
Dann gibt es keine Fahr-Dienste mehr und die Menschen können nicht zur Party kommen.
Sie können auch nicht nach Hause kommen.
Das ist sehr schade.
Einige Menschen in Berlin wollen das ändern.
Sie wollen Menschen mit Behinderungen und elektronische Musik zusammenbringen.
Welche Verbindungen gibt es bereits ?
Der Verein Lebenshilfe will eine eigene Platten-Firma für Menschen mit Behinderungen gründen.
Das ist ein großes Ziel.
Aber zuerst fängt der Verein klein an.
Er organisiert verschiedene Musik-Angebote für Menschen mit Behinderungen.
Dazu gehören zum Beispiel: • eine Arbeits-Gruppe zum Musik machen • eine inklusive Party
Was ist die Arbeits-Gruppe zum Musik machen ?
Der Verein Lebenshilfe organisiert eine Arbeits-Gruppe zum Musik machen.
Die Arbeits-Gruppe heißt: Ick mach Welle.
In der Arbeits-Gruppe können Menschen mit Behinderungen verschiedene Instrumente ausprobieren.
Dazu gehören zum Beispiel auch Geräte von einem DJ.
Was ist ein DJ ?
DJ spricht man so aus:
Di-Dschey.
DJ ist die Abkürzung für das englische Wort Discjockey.
Disjockey spricht man so aus:
Disk-Dschocki.
DJs arbeiten oft auf Partys.
Sie machen Musik zum Tanzen.
In Berlin machen DJs oft elektronische Musik.
Die Arbeits-Gruppe wird begleitet von Musikern.
Sie erklären die Instrumente und Geräte.
Dazu gehören zum Beispiel Computer-Programme, Schlag-Zeug und Platten-Teller für Schall-Platten.
Die Arbeits-Gruppe probiert alles aus.
Und dann macht sie selbst Musik.
Bisher bekommt die Arbeits-Gruppe Geld von der Stadt Berlin.
Und sie bekommt Unterstützung von Instrumente-Herstellern.
Aber es fehlt noch Geld.
Zum Beispiel für einen Probe-Raum.
Was ist die inklusive Party ?
In Berlin-Lichtenberg gibt es diesen Club:
Mensch Meier.
Dort findet ab und zu eine inklusive Party statt.
Die Party heißt: Spaceship.
Spaceship spricht man so aus:
Speys-Schipp.
Das ist Englisch und heißt übersetzt: Raum-Schiff.
Die Party ist für Menschen mit und ohne Behinderungen.
Alle können hier zu elektronischer Musik tanzen.
Es läuft aber auch Hip-Hop und Funk.
Funk spricht man so aus:
Fank.
Die Party macht viel Spaß.
Es sollte noch viel mehr Partys für Menschen mit ohne Behinderungen geben.
Denn eine gemeinsame Party ist sehr schön.
Frankreich gewinnt gegen Belgien
Die französische Mannschaft kann sich freuen.
Sie zieht in das WM-Finale ein.
Frankreich zieht in das WM-Finale ein.
Belgien scheidet aus der WM aus.
Hier alle wichtigen Infos zum Spiel.
► Wie ging das Spiel aus ?
Belgien schießt kein Tor.
Frankreich schießt ein Tor.
Frankreich gewinnt.
► Wie lief das Spiel ab ?
Das Spiel beginnt:
Und Frankreich schießt die Bälle erstmal nicht ordentlich.
Es gibt mehrere Fehl-Pässe.
Das bedeutet: Die französischen Spieler schießen den Ball ihren Mitspielern nicht genau genug zu.
So vergeben die Franzosen einige Tor-Chancen an den Gegner.
Belgien ist erst einmal die stärkere Mannschaft.
Die belgischen Spieler tanzen mit und lauern auf den Ball.
Aber Frankreich kann immer auf einen Spieler setzen.
Das ist Kylian Mbappé.
Er ist erst 19 Jahre alt.
Er ist wahnsinnig schnell.
Er schießt den Ball im Spiel immer in die richtige Richtung.
Hier ist ein Bild von Kylian Mbappé:
Die französische Mannschaft steigt so immer mehr ins Spiel ein.
Sie zeigt immer mehr Einsatz.
Und dann: Frankreich bekommt einen Eckball.
Und die Mannschaft nutzt die Chance !
Der Ball landet im Tor !
Der französische Tor-Schütze heißt Samuel Umtiti.
Hier ist ein Bild von diesem Moment:
In den letzten 30 Minuten zeigt Frankreich noch mehr Leidenschaft.
Das kennt man gar nicht von französischen Mannschaften.
Frankreich ist stark in der Abwehr.
Die Mannschaft spielt klug und konzentriert.
Frankreich gewinnt verdient und zieht ins WM-Finale ein.
Es ist das dritte Mal, dass eine französische Mannschaft das schafft.
Ob Frankreich sein spielerisches Können dort halten kann ?
Wir werden sehen.
Schade ist trotzdem, dass die Belgier draußen sind.
Die belgische Mannschaft galt als Geheim-Favorit.
Und viele Fans haben die Mannschaft lieb gewonnen.
Zu wenig Inklusion bei der Arbeit
Seit 10 Jahren gibt es die Behinderten-Rechts-Konvention.
Was hat sich seitdem in Deutschland verändert ?
Seit 10 Jahren gibt es die UN-Behinderten-Rechts-Konvention.
Das ist ein wichtiger Vertrag.
177 Länder haben diesen Vertrag unterschrieben.
Der Vertrag gilt auch in Deutschland.
Darin steht: Menschen mit Behinderungen haben die gleichen Rechte wie alle anderen Menschen.
Das gilt für alle Lebens-Bereiche:
für die Schule, die Arbeit und beim Wohnen.
Wenn alle Menschen überall mitmachen können, dann nennt man das Inklusion.
Inklusion ist ein Menschen-Recht.
Auch Deutschland soll die UN-Behinderten-Rechts-Konvention umsetzen.
Das versucht Deutschland seit 10 Jahren.
Aktuell fragen sich viele Menschen: Was hat Deutschland bei der Inklusion erreicht ?
Zum Beispiel beim Thema Arbeit ?
Das Institut für Menschen-Rechte hat diese Fragen beantwortet.
Die Fachleute dort sagen: Deutschland tut zu wenig beim Thema Arbeit.
Inklusion findet auf dem 1. Arbeits-Markt kaum statt.
Die Fachleute geben dafür diese Beispiele:
• Menschen mit einer anerkannten Schwerbehinderung sind oft Jahre lang arbeitslos.
• Immer mehr Menschen arbeiten in Behinderten-Werkstätten.
Warum ist das so ?
Und was muss sich ändern ?
Die taz spricht darüber mit Annelie Buntenbach.
Sie arbeitet beim Deutschen Gewerkschafts-Bund.
Sie kennt sich mit den Themen Arbeit und Politik aus.
Die taz erklärt: 37000 deutsche Unternehmen stellen keine Menschen mit Behinderungen ein.
Dabei gibt es dazu ein Gesetz in Deutschland.
Das Gesetz gilt für alle Unternehmen mit über 20 Mitarbeitern.
In dem Gesetz steht: 5 Prozent der Mitarbeiter müssen eine anerkannte Schwerbehinderung haben.
Das heißt: Einer von 20 Mitarbeitern muss schwerbehindert sein.
Aber viele Unternehmen halten sich nicht an das Gesetz.
Sie bezahlen lieber eine Geld-Strafe, weil sie keine Menschen mit Behinderungen einstellen.
Deshalb sind viele Menschen mit Behinderungen arbeitslos.
Frau Buntenbach sagt dazu: Die Geld-Strafe ist zu niedrig.
Die Unternehmen müssen mehr Verantwortung übernehmen.
Sie sollen mehr Geld bezahlen, wenn sie keine Menschen mit Schwerbehinderung einstellen.
Frau Buntenbach sagt aber auch: Es gibt kleine Fortschritte beim Thema Inklusion.
Einige Unternehmen sind offener geworden.
Und es gibt auch bessere Ausbildungs-Möglichkeiten für Menschen mit Behinderungen.
Deshalb arbeiten heute mehr Menschen mit Behinderungen auf dem 1. Arbeits-Markt.
Trotzdem gibt es noch viel zu tun bei der Ausbildung und bei der Arbeits-Suche.
Und die Arbeitgeber müssen noch mehr über Inklusion erfahren.
Die taz erklärt: 270000 Menschen arbeiten in Behinderten-Werkstätten.
Das sind mehr Menschen als vor 10 Jahren.
Sie bekommen meistens keinen Mindestlohn.
Sie verdienen oft unter 200 Euro im Monat.
Frau Buntenbach sagt dazu: Wir brauchen die Behinderten-Werkstätten.
Nicht alle Menschen mit Behinderungen sind arbeitsfähig.
Sie finden einfach keine Arbeit auf dem 1. Arbeits-Markt.
Diese Menschen brauchen eine Werkstatt-Beschäftigung.
Deshalb gibt es auch keinen Mindestlohn.
Sonst würden die Werkstätten genau prüfen, welche Beschäftigen sie einstellen.
Dann ist die Werkstatt nicht mehr offen für alle.
Frau Buntenbach sagt aber auch: Viele Menschen mit Behinderungen sind arbeitsfähig.
Sie können auf dem 1. Arbeits-Markt arbeiten.
Sie dürfen nicht in der Werkstatt feststecken.
Die Werkstätten müssen diese Menschen stärker unterstützen bei der Ausbildung und Arbeits-Suche.
Lasst die Freibäder offen !
Viele Gemeinden in Deutschland haben wenig Geld.
Deshalb müssen immer mehr Freibäder schließen.
Das darf nicht passieren !
Freibäder sind wichtig !
Wie toll so ein Freibad ist !
Das Wasser im Becken leuchtet hellblau.
Der Rasen ist schön grün und frisch gemäht.
Und es gibt viel zu sehen:
Überall laufen, liegen und schwimmen Menschen.
Sie springen von hohen Sprung-Brettern ins Wasser.
So ein Freibad begleitet Menschen das ganze Leben lang.
Hier lernen sie schwimmen und treffen Freunde.
Hier finden sie Ruhe nach einem stressigen Tag.
Aber im Jahr 2017 mussten 62 Freibäder schließen.
Das nennt man auch: Bäder-Sterben.
Wieso schließen die Freibäder ?
Weil sie viel Geld kosten.
Das Personal und der Strom kosten viel Geld.
Und viele Freibäder sind alt und müssen erneuert werden.
Auch diese Bau-Arbeiten kosten viel Geld.
Und all das Geld muss jemand bezahlen.
Freibäder nehmen zwar Eintritt ein, aber diese Einnahmen reichen oft nicht aus.
Die Kosten für den Betrieb sind höher als die Einnahmen.
Jeder soll sich den Eintritt leisten können
Unser taz-Autor findet: Klar, man könnte jetzt mehr Eintritt nehmen.
Aber das Tolle am Freibad ist ja die demokratische Idee dahinter.
Das bedeutet: Jeder kann sich den Eintritt leisten.
So treffen ganz unterschiedliche Menschen aufeinander.
Sie alle können im Freibad ein Teil von der Gesellschaft sein.
Deshalb dürfen Freibäder nicht schließen !
Freibäder gehören zu den Städten und Gemeinden.
Die Städte und Gemeinden haben eine Pflicht:
Sie müssen die Freibäder mit Geld unterstützen.
Sie müssen Freibäder genauso unterstützen wie Büchereien, Museen und Theater.
Viele Städte und Gemeinden tun das auch.
Sie geben bei 3 Euro Eintritt ungefähr 6 Euro dazu.
Das ist insgesamt viel Geld für die Städte und Gemeinden.
Die Städte und Gemeinden haben immer weniger Geld
Das Problem dabei ist: Viele Städte und Gemeinden müssen Geld sparen.
Und wo sparen sie zuerst ?
Bei den Freibädern.
Denn die Freibäder gehören zu den freiwilligen Aufgaben.
Das bedeutet: Die Freibäder sind ein Extra für die Bürger.
Aber die Städte und Gemeinden müssen sie nicht unbedingt betreiben.
Unser taz-Autor findet das sehr schade.
Denn wenn die Freibäder sterben, dann stirbt auch ein Ort für die Gemeinschaft.
Proteste im Hambacher Forst
Der Energie-Konzern RWE will einen Wald fällen.
Viele Menschen protestieren dagegen.
In Nordrhein-Westfalen gibt es einen Wald.
Der Wald heißt Hambacher Forst.
Der Wald war mal sehr groß.
Er war so groß wie 17-Tausend Fußball-Felder.
Dann fällte ein Energie-Konzern die Bäume.
Heute ist der Wald deshalb viel kleiner.
Heute ist der Wald nur noch so groß wie 280 Fußball-Felder.
Warum ist der Hambacher Forst heute so klein ?
In der Erde im Hambacher Forst gibt es Braun-Kohle.
Der Energie-Konzern RWE will diese Braun-Kohle abbauen.
Warum ?
Der Energie-Konzern will Strom aus der Braun-Kohle erzeugen.
Deshalb fällt der Energie-Konzern die Bäume im Hambacher Forst.
Viele Menschen wollen den Hambacher Forst retten.
Sie protestieren, damit nicht noch mehr Bäume gefällt werden.
Wie machen sie das genau ?
Die Menschen besetzen seit 6 Jahren den Hambacher Forst.
Das heißt: Sie wohnen auf den Bäumen in Baum-Häusern.
Sie haben die Baum-Häuser selbst gebaut.
Die Menschen verhindern so, dass die Bäume gefällt werden.
Denn: Wenn Menschen auf einem Baum wohnen, dann darf der Baum nicht gefällt werden.
Es gibt mehr als 30 Baum-Häuser im Hambacher Forst.
Insgesamt können mehr als 100 Menschen dort schlafen und leben.
Es gibt noch mehr Gründe für den Protest
Die Menschen protestieren noch aus einem anderen Grund.
Sie sind gegen die Strom-Erzeugung mit Braun-Kohle.
Warum ?
Braun-Kohle ist eine Quelle zur Strom-Erzeugung.
Andere Quellen sind zum Beispiel Atom-Kraft oder Wind-Kraft.
Bei der Strom-Erzeugung mit Braun-Kohle kommen viele schädliche Stoffe in die Luft.
Das ist schlecht für die Umwelt und für das Klima.
Deshalb soll es in Deutschland bald keinen Strom mehr aus Braun-Kohle geben.
Das hat die Politik in Deutschland so entschieden.
Deshalb sagen die Menschen, die im Hambacher Forst protestieren: Es ist nicht nötig, den Wald jetzt noch abzuholzen.
Die Energie-Erzeugung aus Braun-Kohle hat keine Zukunft.
Polizei geht gegen den Protest vor
Der Protest im Hambacher Forst ist nicht immer friedlich.
Oft gibt es Streit mit Angestellten von dem Energie-Konzern RWE.
Denn die Angestellten wollen den Wald vorbereiten, damit die Bäume gefällt werden können.
Die Polizei hilft dem Energie-Konzern dabei.
Die Polizei versucht dann, die Menschen aus den Baum-Häusern zu holen.
Das läuft nicht immer ohne Streit ab.
Wie ist die aktuelle Lage im Hambacher Forst ?
Aktuell wird der Streit im Hambacher Forst sehr ernst.
Die Polizei hat am 13. und 14. September wieder versucht, die Menschen aus den Bäum-Häusern zu holen.
Hier ist ein Bild davon:
Die Polizei hat dafür die Erlaubnis vom Land Nordrhein-Westfalen.
Das Land Nordrhein-Westfalen sagt: Die Baum-Häuser sind unsicher.
Es könnte im Wald brennen.
Das ist gefährlich für die Menschen.
Diese Begründung vom Land Nordrhein-Westfalen ist seltsam.
Denn es hat in den vergangenen Tagen geregnet.
Es kann also kein Feuer ausbrechen.
Deshalb vermuten viele Menschen: Die Begründung ist eine Ausrede.
Das Land Nordrhein-Westfalen will dem Energie-Konzern RWE dabei helfen, den Wald zu fällen.
Aktuell sind also wieder sehr viele Polizisten im Hambacher Forst.
Sie haben die ersten Baum-Häuser geräumt und zerstört.
Eigentlich sollte das ohne Gewalt passieren.
Das ist den Polizisten nicht gelungen.
Denn die Menschen in den Baum-Häusern wollen bleiben.
Sie wollen weiter für den Wald kämpfen.
Sie klammern sich an die Bäume.
Denn sie kämpfen schon so lange für den Wald.
Viele andere Menschen aus ganz Deutschland sind auch zu den Baum-Häusern gekommen.
Sie protestieren hier vom Boden aus.
Sie wollen zeigen: Wir wollen den Wald auch retten.
Wir unterstützen die Menschen in den Baum-Häusern.
Wie der Protest im Hambacher Forst ausgeht, ist noch nicht sicher.
Das werden die nächsten Tage zeigen.
Gewalt gegen Frauen mit Behinderungen
Frauen mit Behinderungen erleben öfter Gewalt.
Was kann man dagegen tun ?
Die Zeitung taz spricht mit Claudia Chodzinski.
Chodzinski spricht man so aus:
Kod-schins-ki.
Claudia Chodzinski arbeitet beim Frauen-Notruf in Hannover.
Sie hilft dort Frauen, die Gewalt erlebt haben.
Die taz spricht mit Claudia Chodzinski über ihre Arbeit und über Gewalt an Frauen mit Behinderungen.
Claudia Chodzinski sagt: Frauen mit Behinderungen erleben öfter Gewalt als Frauen ohne Behinderungen.
Die Gefühle von Frauen mit Behinderung werden öfter verletzt.
Ihre Körper werden öfter misshandelt.
Warum erleben Frauen mit Behinderungen Gewalt ?
Claudia Chodzinski sagt: Viele Frauen mit Behinderung können sich schlecht gegen Gewalt wehren.
Sie können sich schlechter gegen Gewalt wehren als Frauen ohne Behinderungen.
Das gilt vor allem für Frauen mit einer seelischen Behinderung.
Ein Grund dafür ist: Viele Frauen mit Behinderung sind von anderen Menschen abhängig.
Sie brauchen Hilfe im Alltag.
Sie werden von der Familie oder von Betreuern betreut.
Sie haben dabei oft wenig Privatsphäre.
Zur Privatsphäre gehört zum Beispiel der eigene Körper.
Bei der Betreuung ist oft schwer zu sagen, wo die Privatsphäre beginnt und wo die Privatsphäre aufhört.
Zum Beispiel beim Waschen: Ein Betreuer fasst eine Frau mit Behinderung beim Waschen an, zum Beispiel an den Geschlechts-Organen.
Dabei ist nicht immer klar: Wo genau darf der Betreuer die Frau anfassen ?
Wie darf der Betreuer die Frau anfassen ?
Wo beginnt Gewalt und Misshandlung ?
Wie soll die Frau sagen, wenn sie etwas nicht möchte ?
Manchen Frauen mit Behinderungen fällt es schwer, über Gewalt durch Betreuer zu sprechen.
Manche Frauen können nicht so gut sprechen.
Manche Frauen haben Angst vor dem Betreuer.
Sie sind oft von der Betreuung abhängig.
Claudia Chodzinski berichtet von einem weiteren Beispiel:
Eine Frau mit Behinderungen fühlte sich durch einen Mann bedroht.
Sie wusste nicht, wie sie darüber reden soll.
Sie hat dann aufgehört, sich zu waschen.
Sie dachte: Wenn ich schlecht rieche, fasst mich der Mann nicht mehr an.
Wie kann man den Frauen helfen ?
Claudia Chodzinski will Frauen mit Behinderungen vor Gewalt beschützen.
Dafür hat sie ein Projekt gestartet.
Das Projekt heißt: "Behindert sexuelle Gewalt".
Claudia Chodzinski spricht dabei zum Beispiel mit diesen Personen:
• Betreuern von Menschen mit Behinderungen
• Familien von Frauen mit Behinderungen
• betroffenen Frauen
Sie will Frauen mit Behinderungen dabei unterstützen, über sexuelle Gewalt zu sprechen.
Zum Beispiel über diese Fragen:
• Wo und wie dürfen andere Personen mich anfassen ?
• Welche Rechte habe ich, wenn ich Gewalt erlebe ?
Claudia Chodzinski hofft, dass es so weniger Gewalt gegen Frauen mit Behinderungen gibt.
Bilder über seelische Krankheiten
Menschen mit seelischen Krankheiten sehen in der Zeitung oft traurig aus.
Das muss sich ändern.
Es gibt bessere Bilder.
Franziska Seyboldt hat eine Angst-Störung.
Wie sie damit klarkommt ?
Das erklärt Franziska in diesem Text:
Ich heiße Franziska und habe eine seelische Krankheit.
Ich habe eine Angst-Störung.
Das bedeutet: Ich habe oft Angst, auch wenn es keinen Grund dafür gibt.
Ich habe oft Angst, wenn andere Menschen keine Angst haben.
Ich habe zum Beispiel Angst in der U-Bahn.
Ich habe dann das Gefühl, dass ich keine Luft bekomme.
Warum ich diese Angst habe ?
Das kann ich nicht immer erklären.
Warum finde ich die Bilder über seelische Krankheiten oft schlecht ?
Viele Menschen in Deutschland haben seelische Krankheiten.
In den Zeitungen gibt es viele Texte darüber.
Aber diese Texte ärgern mich oft.
Mein Problem ist: Ich finde die Bilder in den Texten oft schlecht.
Die Bilder verstärken oft Vorurteile über seelische Krankheiten.
Die Bilder zeigen zum Beispiel: • Menschen, die weinen und in einer Zimmer-Ecke sitzen • Menschen, die sich hinter ihren Händen verstecken • Menschen, die Tabletten nehmen
Diese Art von Bildern wirkt traurig und ablehnend.
Man denkt dann: Menschen mit seelischen Krankheiten geht es immer schlecht.
Menschen mit seelischen Krankheiten sind immer einsam.
Aber das stimmt nicht.
Welche Bilder sind besser geeignet ?
Seelische Krankheiten finden im Kopf statt.
Man kann seelische Krankheiten also nicht sehen.
Deshalb kann man seelische Krankheiten schlecht auf Bildern zeigen.
Aber es gibt auch gute Bilder von Menschen mit seelischen Krankheiten.
Hier ist ein Beispiel aus meinem Leben:
Ich habe einen Text über meine Angst geschrieben.
Und ein Fotograf hat Fotos von mir gemacht.
Die Fotos zeigen, wie ich tanze und lache.
Denn Menschen mit seelischen Krankheiten können auch lachen und glücklich sein.
Solche Bilder will ich in der Zeitung sehen !
Die taz berichtet über die Europa-Wahl
Bald findet die Europa-Wahl statt.
Die Zeitung taz berichtet darüber.
Auch in Leichter Sprache.
Bald findet die Europa-Wahl statt.
Viele Menschen in Europa wählen bei der Wahl mit.
Sie wählen die Mitglieder vom Europäischen Parlament.
Das Europäische Parlament hat wichtige Aufgaben in der EU.
EU ist eine Abkürzung für: Europäische Union.
Die EU besteht aus 28 Mitglieds-Ländern.
Die Mitglieds-Länder arbeiten bei Politik und Wirtschaft zusammen.
Deutschland ist auch EU-Mitglied.
In Deutschland ist die Europa-Wahl am 26. Mai 2019.
Viele Wähler fragen sich aktuell: Was ist mir wichtig ?
Welche Parteien soll ich wählen ?
Die Antwort darauf ist nicht leicht.
Denn die EU ist groß.
Es gibt viele wichtige Themen.
Die taz berichtet deshalb über diese Themen.
Sie berichtet 3 Wochen lang über die Europa-Wahl.
Worüber berichtet die taz genau ?
Die taz will diese Fragen beantworten:
Was ist die EU ?
Wie wollen die Menschen dort leben ?
Welche Wünsche haben diese Menschen ?
Die taz will gute Antworten darauf finden.
Sie berichtet deshalb von vielen Orten.
taz-Mitarbeiter berichten aus Ländern in der EU und außerhalb der EU.
taz-Mitarbeiter berichten zum Beispiel über diese Themen:
• den Alltag von Menschen in der EU
• die politischen Probleme
• die Flucht nach Europa
• Gefahren durch rechte Parteien
Die taz-Mitarbeiter berichten in "schwerer" Sprache.
Die "schweren" Texte gibt es hier.
Es soll aber auch einige leichte Texte geben.
Die taz will deshalb wissen: Welche Themen finden Sie wichtig ?
Welche Texte soll es in Leichter Sprache geben ?

Neue Vorsitzende bei den Grünen
Die Partei Die Grünen hat 2 neue Vorsitzende.
Sie wollen eine neue Politik für die Grünen.
Die Grünen haben 2 neue Vorsitzende gewählt.
Die neuen Vorsitzenden heißen: Annalena Baerbock [ gesprochen: Bärbock ] und Robert Habeck.
Die neuen Vorsitzenden sind jung.
Sie haben neue Ideen.
Mit diesen Ideen wollen sie die Partei neu gestalten.
Warum könnte das schwierig werden ?
In der Partei Die Grünen gibt es 2 Gruppen.
Eine Gruppe möchte eine linke Politik.
Diese Gruppe nennt man: Linke.
Eine andere Gruppe möchte auch eine linke Politik.
Doch diese Gruppe möchte sich dabei an andere Parteien anpassen.
Denn diese Gruppe möchte, dass die Grünen in Deutschland mitregieren können.
Diese Gruppe nennt man: Realos.
Linke und Realos streiten oft, wie die Politik bei den Grünen sein soll.
Bisher war es bei den Grünen so:
Ein Vorsitzender kam von den Linken.
Und ein Vorsitzender kam von den Realos.
Sie waren sich bei vielen Themen nicht einig.
Mit den neuen Vorsitzenden ist es bei den Grünen so:
Annalena Baerbock und Robert Habeck sind beide von den Realos.
Sie sind sich bei vielen Themen einig.
Viele Menschen glauben zwar: Annalena Baerbock und Robert Habeck setzen sich nicht für die Politik von der linken Gruppe ein.
Annalena Baerbock und Robert Habeck sagen aber: Wir sprechen auch über linke Themen.
Wir wollen für alle in der Partei sprechen.
Welche Themen sind Annalena Baerbock wichtig ?
Annalena Baerbock ist 37 Jahre alt.
Sie kommt aus dem Bundesland Brandenburg.
Annalena Baerbock findet diese linken Themen wichtig für die Politik der Grünen:
Klima-Schutz und Familien-Nachzug.
Annalena Baerbock will sich für den Klima-Schutz einsetzen.
Sie sagt: Die Grünen müssen noch mehr gegen den Klima-Wandel tun.
Der Klima-Wandel nimmt weiter zu.
Durch die Abgase von Autos und Fabriken steigt die Temperatur auf der Erde.
Es wird immer wärmer.
Das ist gefährlich für die Menschen und für die Natur.
Annalena Baerbock will den Familien-Nachzug für Flüchtlinge.
Was ist der Familien-Nachzug ?
Viele Flüchtlinge kommen alleine nach Deutschland.
Viele Flüchtlinge wollen, dass ihre Familien-Mitglieder später nach Deutschland nachkommen können.
Sie vermissen ihre Eltern, Partner und Kinder.
Außerdem: Viele Familien von Flüchtlingen sind in ihrer Heimat in Gefahr.
Dort gibt es oft Krieg, Verfolgung und Hunger.
Welche Themen sind Robert Habeck wichtig ?
Robert Habeck ist 48 Jahre alt.
Er kommt aus dem Bundesland Schleswig-Holstein.
Robert Habeck findet das linke Thema " Umverteilung " wichtig für die Politik der Grünen.
Das bedeutet: Ärmere Menschen sollen mehr Geld bekommen.
Reichere Menschen sollen mehr Geld abgeben.
Zum Beispiel sollen reichere Menschen mehr Steuern bezahlen.
Rassismus im Alltag
Viele Menschen schreiben aktuell über ihre Rassismus-Erlebnisse in Deutschland.
Sie wollen Aufmerksamkeit für dieses Thema.
Im Internet gibt es die Plattform Twitter.
Viele Menschen veröffentlichen hier Nachrichten.
Sie veröffentlichen kurze Texte, aber auch Videos und Fotos.
Oft geht es dabei um aktuelle Themen.
Aktuell schreiben viele Menschen bei Twitter über Rassismus.
Was ist Rassismus ?
Man spricht zum Beispiel von Rassismus, wenn Menschen wegen ihrer Haut-Farbe oder Herkunft: • benachteiligt werden, • für dumm gehalten werden, • beleidigt werden.
Es gibt verschiedene Formen von Rassismus.
Manche Menschen denken: Du bist anders als ich, weil du anders aussiehst oder woanders herkommst.
Andere Menschen denken: Du bist schlechter als ich, weil du anders aussiehst oder woanders herkommst.
Manche Menschen denken ganz allgemein: Menschen wie du sind schlechter als Menschen wie ich.
Viele Menschen schreiben jetzt über Rassismus in ihrem Alltag.
Sie erzählen, wie sie Rassismus in Deutschland erleben.
Dabei benutzen sie diesen Spruch:
Me Two.
Das spricht man so aus:
Mi Tu.
Das ist Englisch und heißt übersetzt: Ich zwei.
Der Spruch bedeutet: Ich bin nicht nur deutsch.
Ich habe auch eine andere Herkunft.
Und ich bin von Rassismus betroffen.
Auch taz-Autorinnen und Autoren sind davon betroffen.
2 taz-Autorinnen erzählen ihre Erlebnisse bei taz leicht.
Das sind Lin Hierse und Katja Musafiri.
Von welchen Erlebnissen erzählt Lin Hierse ?
Lin Hierse erzählt: In der Schule hatte ich viele schlechte Erlebnisse.
Einmal wollte ich als Prinzessin zum Fasching gehen.
Aber die anderen haben gesagt: In Asien gibt es keine Prinzessinnen.
Dann hat meine Mutter für mich ein Mulan-Kostüm gebastelt.
Mulan ist eine Figur aus einem Film, der in China spielt.
Ich musste also Mulan sein, weil ich so ähnlich aussehe wie sie.
Ich durfte nicht Schneewittchen oder Rapunzel sein.
Ein anderes Mal hat jemand an die Tafel geschrieben: Chinesen sind Hunde-Fresser.
Alle haben mich angeschaut.
Das war mir sehr unangenehm.
Dabei esse ich gar keine Hunde.
Lin Hierse erzählt auch: In der Arbeit und in der Freizeit behandeln mich die Leute manchmal anders.
Sie fragen: Wo kommst du wirklich her ?
Dabei ist die Antwort klar:
Ich bin Deutsche.
Ich komme aus Deutschland.
Von welchen Erlebnissen erzählt Katja Musafiri ?
Katja Musafiri erzählt: Als Kind war ich im Urlaub.
Ein paar Leute haben gesagt: Jetzt trinkt das Vieh auch noch.
Sie meinten nicht die Kuh auf der Wiese.
Sie meinten mich.
Viele Menschen sehen mich voller Ekel an.
Sie beleidigen mich ohne Grund, nur weil ich anders aussehe als sie.
Wenn ich in Not bin, bitte ich nur selten um Hilfe.
Denn ich habe Angst, dass die Menschen mir noch mehr schaden könnten.
Katja Musafiri sagt auch: Ich will nicht mehr schweigen.
Ich will diese Geschichten erzählen.
Die Menschen sollen wissen, wie es mir geht.
Andere Menschen können nicht darüber entscheiden, ob ich Deutsche bin.
Ich bin Deutsche.
Und ich möchte eine gute Zukunft für meinen Sohn.
Keine Angst vor der Masern-Impfung
Der Kinder-Arzt Christof Metzler findet Impfungen wichtig.
Aber er versteht auch die Ängste der Eltern.
Die taz hat mit dem Kinder-Arzt Christof Metzler über Masern gesprochen.
Masern sind eine häufige Krankheit bei Kindern.
Masern werden zum Beispiel beim Niesen über die Luft übertragen.
Wenn ein Kind an Masern erkrankt, dann hat es zum Beispiel diese Krankheits-Anzeichen: Fieber, Husten, Schnupfen und einen juckenden Ausschlag.
Sind Masern gefährlich ?
Ja, Masern können gefährlich werden.
Weltweit sterben jeden Tag ungefähr 400 Kinder an Masern.
Viele Eltern gehen deshalb zum Kinder-Arzt.
Dort bekommen die Kinder eine Masern-Schutz-Impfung.
Das funktioniert so:
Der Arzt gibt den Kindern eine Spritze mit schwachen Masern-Viren.
Ein anderes Wort für Viren ist: Krankheits-Erreger.
Der Körper von dem Kind bekämpft dann die Krankheits-Erreger.
Dabei bildet der Körper Abwehr-Kräfte gegen Masern-Viren.
Das Kind kann nach der Masern-Schutz-Impfung nicht mehr an Masern erkranken.
Kein Vertrauen in die Impfung
Manche Eltern sind gegen die Masern-Schutz-Impfung.
Sie glauben: • Es ist natürlich und gehört zum Leben dazu, dass Kinder Masern bekommen. • Die Masern-Impfung hat viele Nebenwirkungen.
Oft gibt es Streit darüber, ob die Schutz-Impfung gegen Masern gut oder schlecht ist.
Was sagt der Kinder-Arzt Christof Metzler im taz-Gespräch zum Streit ?
Christof Metzler findet die Masern-Schutz-Impfung wichtig.
Er hat dafür mehrere Gründe.
Er sagt: Ja, die Masern-Schutz-Impfung kann Nebenwirkungen haben.
Eine Art Masern-Erkrankung kann ausbrechen.
Aber das ist nur eine schwache Erkrankung und kommt sehr selten vor.
Ohne Schutz-Impfung erkrankt man eher an Masern.
Und dann ist die Masern-Erkrankung stärker und gefährlicher.
Eine Masern-Erkrankung hat zum Beispiel diese Folge:
Lungen-Entzündung.
Trotzdem sind auch einige Ärzte in Deutschland gegen die Masern-Impfung.
Ungefähr 3 von 100 Ärzten sind dagegen.
Christof Metzler versteht diese Ärzte nicht.
Er sagt: Die Masern-Schutz-Impfung ist wichtig.
Denn Masern können für Kinder tödlich sein.
Weitere Kritik an der Masern-Impfung
Eine weitere Kritik gegen die Masern-Schutz-Impfung lautet: Kinder bekommen in den ersten Lebens-Jahren zu viele Schutz-Impfungen.
Denn auch gegen viele andere Krankheiten gibt es eine Schutz-Impfung.
Dazu gehören zum Beispiel: Röteln, Hepatitis B, Grippe, Windpocken oder Mumps.
Sind so viele Schutz-Impfungen gut für ein Kind ?
Christof Metzler sagt dazu: Der Körper von Kindern verträgt mehrere Schutz-Impfungen.
Das Abwehr-System von Kindern hält viel aus.
Die Eltern müssen keine Angst vor Schutz-Impfungen haben.
Die Ängste von den Eltern versteht Christof Metzler trotzdem.
Christof Metzler sagt: Die Eltern wollen nur das Beste für ihr Kind.
Und der Staat und viele Ärzte beraten Eltern oft schlecht über die Schutz-Impfung.
Viele Eltern informieren sich deshalb im Internet.
Aber Informationen im Internet sind manchmal falsch.
Christof Metzler sagt: Wir Ärzte müssen wieder Vertrauen bei Schutz-Impfungen herstellen.
Wir Ärzte müssen Eltern besser informieren.
Klima-Schutz in Europa
Am 26. Mai 2019 ist die Europa-Wahl.
Was sagen die Politiker in Europa vor der Wahl zum Klima-Schutz ?
Aktuell reden viele Menschen über Klima-Schutz.
Sie fragen sich zum Beispiel: Wie kann man das schädliche CO2 verringern ?
CO2 ist eine Art von Abgas.
Es entsteht zum Beispiel beim Heizen und Auto-Fahren, wenn Benzin, Öl oder Gas verbrannt wird.
Zu viel CO2 verändert das Klima auf der Welt.
Warum reden viele Menschen über Klima-Schutz ?
In vielen Städten gibt es freitags Schüler-Proteste.
Die Schüler sind nicht einverstanden mit der Umwelt-Politik und fordern mehr Klima-Schutz.
Die Proteste gibt es in mehreren Ländern in Europa.
Sie heißen: Fridays for Future ( gesprochen: Freideys for Fjutschar ).
Auf Deutsch heißt das: freitags für die Zukunft.
Aktuell gibt es noch mehr Schüler-Proteste in Europa.
Denn am 26. Mai ist die Europa-Wahl.
Und die Schüler fordern zur Wahl: Die Politiker in Europa sollen über Klima-Schutz sprechen.
Sprechen die Politiker über Klima-Schutz ?
Einige Politiker in Europa sprechen über Klima-Schutz, zum Beispiel Emmanuel Macron.
Er ist der Präsident von Frankreich.
Er sieht so aus:
Emmanuel Macron hat diesen Klima-Schutz-Plan:
Europa soll bis zum Jahr 2050 klima-neutral werden.
Das bedeutet: Europa soll bis 2050 den CO2-Ausstoß stark verringern.
Das restliche CO2 soll man ausgleichen, zum Beispiel mit neu gepflanzten Bäumen.
Denn Bäume sind gut für das Klima.
Sie verwandeln CO2 in Sauerstoff und sorgen so für frische Luft.
Was sagen andere Länder in Europa zu diesem Klima-Schutz-Plan ?
8 Länder wollen bei dem Plan mitmachen, zum Beispiel Schweden, Spanien und Portugal.
Sie wollen auch klima-neutral werden.
Aber was ist mit Deutschland ?
Deutschland will bisher nicht mitmachen.
Denn Bundes-Kanzlerin Angela Merkel sagt: Man kann über den Plan nachdenken.
Aber eigentlich hat Deutschland eigene Klima-Schutz-Ziele.
Das Problem bei den deutschen Zielen ist: Deutschland erreicht seine Ziele bisher nicht.
Die Industrie, Heizungen und Autos stoßen noch zu viel CO2 aus.
Eigentlich sollte der CO2-Ausstoß schon weniger sein.
Einige Menschen fordern deshalb neue Lösungen, zum Beispiel eine CO2-Steuer.
Das bedeutet: Wenn Unternehmen CO2 ausstoßen, dann müssen sie dafür Steuern bezahlen.
Die Hoffnung dabei ist: Unternehmen stoßen in Zukunft weniger CO2 aus, damit sie weniger CO2-Steuer zahlen müssen.
Deutschland verliert gegen Mexiko
Die Deutsche Mannschaft verliert das erste WM-Spiel.
Mexikos Mannschaft gewinnt.
Hier alle wichtigen Infos zum Spiel.
Der Frust bei der deutschen Mannschaft ist groß.
Die Mannschaft verliert ihr erstes WM-Spiel.
Hier alle wichtigen Infos zum Spiel.
► Wie ging das Spiel aus ?
Deutschland schießt kein Tor.
Mexiko schießt 1 Tor.
Mexiko gewinnt.
► Wie lief das Spiel ab ?
Die deutsche Mannschaft spielt ein schwaches Spiel.
Vor allem in der ersten Halbzeit.
Die deutschen Spieler wirken müde.
Sie laufen wenig.
Sie sind langsam.
Die deutschen Stürmer haben einige Tor-Chancen.
Doch ihnen fehlt der Wille und die Leidenschaft.
Sie schießen kein Tor.
Mexikos Spieler sind jedoch hellwach.
Mexikos Spieler schießen immer wieder auf das deutsche Tor.
Die deutschen Verteidiger haben viel zu tun.
Sie verhindern einige Tore von Mexiko.
Doch immer gelingt das nicht.
Mexikos Stürmer Hirving Lozano greift immer wieder an.
In Minute 35 ist Hirving Lozano dann erfolgreich.
Er schießt und trifft.
Der deutsche Torwart Manuel Neuer hat keine Chance.
Er kann den Ball nicht halten.
Mexikos Tor bleibt das einzige Tor im Spiel.
Mexiko kann den Vorsprung bis zum Ende halten.
Mexiko gewinnt verdient.
Es ist Mexikos erster Sieg bei einer WM gegen Deutschland.
► Wer ist der wichtigste Spieler im Spiel ?
Natürlich Hirving Lozano von der mexikanischen Mannschaft.
Er schoss das Tor für Mexiko.
Er zeigte keine Angst vor dem starken Gegner Deutschland.
Das Foto zeigt ihn nach dem Tor:
► Was bedeutet Mexikos Sieg für die deutsche Mannschaft ?
Viele Menschen haben vor dem Spiel gedacht: Mexiko ist ein leichter Gegner.
Die deutsche Mannschaft gewinnt auf jeden Fall gegen Mexiko.
Das war falsch.
Die deutsche Mannschaft hat verloren.
Bald spielt Deutschland gegen Schweden und Südkorea.
Wenn Deutschland dann auch so schwach spielt, werden Schweden und Südkorea zu gefährlichen Gegnern.
Kroatien gewinnt gegen England
Kroatien hat es geschafft.
Die Mannschaft zieht ins WM-Finale ein.
Kroatien hat es geschafft.
Die Mannschaft zieht ins WM-Finale ein.
Hier alle wichtigen Infos zum Spiel.
► Wie ging das Spiel aus ?
England schießt 1 Tor.
Kroatien schießt 2 Tore.
Kroatien gewinnt das Spiel.
► Wie lief das Spiel ab ?
England macht schon in der 5. Spiel-Minute das erste Tor.
England macht das Tor aus einer Standard-Situation heraus.
Was ist eine Standard-Situation ?
Standard-Situationen gibt es meist nach einer Spiel-Unterbrechung.
Der Schiedsrichter pfeift, weil der Ball im Aus ist oder es ein Foul ( gesprochen: Faul ) gab.
Danach gibt es einen Einwurf, Eckstoß oder Freistoß.
Das nennt man eine Standard-Situtation.
Die englische Mannschaft bekommt also zu Spiel-Beginn gleich einen Freistoß.
Und der Ball landet im Tor.
Englang führt.
Kroatien hingegen macht viele Fehler.
Die kroatischen Spieler verlieren oft den Ball.
Und zwischen den kroatischen Spielern ist zu viel Abstand.
Sie können sich den Ball deshalb nicht genau genug zuschießen.
In den ersten 45 Minuten des Spiels ändert sich daran nichts.
Und auch die zweite Halbzeit läuft so weiter:
Die Engländer haben Tor-Chancen.
Die Kroaten machen Fehler.
Erst in der 68. Minute ändert sich das.
Da bekommt der kroatische Spieler Šime Vrsaljko den Ball.
Und er trifft.
England und Kroatien haben nun gleich viele Tore.
Wegen des Tor-Gleichstands gibt es eine Spiel-Verlängerung.
Das Spiel dauert 30 Minuten länger.
In der Verlängerung gelingt Kroatien dann der Sieg.
Der Spieler Mario Mandžukić schießt den Ball ins Tor.
Kroatien zieht ins Finale ein.
England ist draußen.
Die Pille für den Mann
Die Pille ist ein beliebtes Verhütungs-Mittel.
Aber für Frauen hat sie viele Neben-Wirkungen.
Wo bleibt die Pille für den Mann ?
Eine Frau und ein Mann haben Sex.
Sie wollen dabei aber keine Kinder zeugen.
Wie verhindern sie eine Schwangerschaft ?
Sie können Verhütungs-Mittel benutzen.
Es gibt viele verschiedene Verhütungs-Mittel.
Es gibt zum Beispiel Kondome, Spritzen, Pflaster und noch vieles mehr.
Auch die Anti-Baby-Pille schützt vor Schwangerschaften.
Diese Pille gibt es seit über 50 Jahren.
Sie ist ein Medikament.
Ein Arzt schreibt ein Rezept für die Pille.
Frauen kaufen die Pille mit dem Rezept in der Apotheke.
Wie nehmen Frauen die Pille ein ?
Frauen nehmen die Pille einmal am Tag.
Sie nehmen die Pille 21 Tage lang.
Danach machen sie für 7 Tage eine Pause.
In dieser Zeit bekommt die Frau ihre Periode.
Was bewirkt die Pille im weiblichen Körper ?
Durch die Pille kommen Hormone in den Körper.
Diese Hormone verhindern den Ei-Sprung.
Das bedeutet: Es gibt keine Ei-Zelle, die beim Sex befruchtet werden kann.
Die Frau kann also nicht schwanger werden.
Die Pille hat auch Nachteile
Die Pille ist ein beliebtes und sicheres Verhütungs-Mittel.
Aber nicht alles ist gut an der Pille.
Denn es gibt die Pille nur für Frauen, nicht für Männer.
Das bedeutet: Viele Frauen müssen sich allein um die Verhütung kümmern.
Sie tragen dabei sehr viel Verantwortung.
Sie müssen viel Geld für die Pille bezahlen.
Sie müssen die Pille regelmäßig schlucken.
Und sie müssen mit den Neben-Wirkungen umgehen.
Zu den Neben-Wirkungen gehören zum Beispiel: • Übelkeit • Kopf-Schmerzen • Brust-Schmerzen • unregelmäßige Blutungen • schlechte Stimmung • weniger Lust auf Sex
Wo bleibt die Pille für Männer ?
Immer weniger junge Frauen nehmen die Pille.
Manche Menschen fragen sich deshalb: Warum gibt es keine Pille für Männer ?
In Wirklichkeit sucht die Forschung schon seit Jahren nach einem Verhütungs-Mittel für Männer.
Forscher auf der ganzen Welt forschen daran.
Zum Beispiel in China, Indien und den USA.
Diese Verhütungs-Mittel für Männer werden aktuell erforscht:
• Pillen
• Salben
• Spritzen
• kleine Schalter im Hoden, die den Spermien-Fluss stoppen
Welche Probleme gibt es bei der Forschung ?
Große Unternehmen
Große Unternehmen bestimmen den Medikamenten-Markt.
Sie entscheiden: Soll ein Medikament in den Verkauf gehen oder nicht ?
Dabei ist für die Unternehmen wichtig, welches Medikament viel Geld einbringt.
Die Anti-Baby-Pille bringt aktuell viel Geld ein.
Das wollen die Unternehmen nicht ändern.
Deshalb bezahlen die Unternehmen nur wenig oder gar kein Geld für die Forschung an Verhütungs-Mitteln für Männer.
Strenge Regeln
Außerdem gibt es strenge Regeln in der Medikamenten-Forschung.
Diese 2 Regeln sind dabei besonders wichtig:
• Das Medikament muss genau getestet werden.
• Das Medikament darf nur wenige Neben-Wirkungen haben.
In jedem Land sind diese Regeln unterschiedlich streng.
Und oft werden diese Regeln noch strenger.
Manchmal müssen Forscher ihre Arbeit dann neu beginnen.
In Indien gibt es zum Beispiel den Forscher Sujoy Guha.
Er forscht seit Jahren an einem Verhütungs-Mittel für Männer.
Er hat eine Gel-Creme erfunden, die den Weg zum Penis verstopft.
So können die Spermien nicht mehr fließen.
Sujoy Guha war oft schon fast fertig mit seiner Erfindung.
Aber dann kamen immer neue Regeln und Sujoy Guha musste mehrfach von vorne anfangen.
Vorurteile
Auch Vorurteile sind ein Problem bei der Pille für Männer.
Oft sind diese Vorurteile FALSCH.
Aber es gibt sie.
Und sie beeinflussen die öffentliche Meinung.
Zum Beispiel gibt es diese Vorurteile:
1. Männer können nicht mal ihre Socken aufheben.
Wie sollen sie dann regelmäßig an die Pille denken ?
2. Männer können nicht schwanger werden.
Also interessieren sie sich auch nicht für Verhütung.
3. Auch wenn Männer die Pille nehmen wollen, dann würden Frauen ihnen bei der Einnahme nicht vertrauen.
Forscher wollten diese Vorurteile nicht glauben.
Sie haben deshalb viele Menschen dazu befragt.
Die meisten Menschen haben gesagt: Sie wollen eine Pille für Männer.
Wie sieht die Zukunft aus ?
Bis die Pille für Männer verkauft wird, müssen noch viele Probleme gelöst werden.
Aber manche Männer wollen nicht warten.
Zum Beispiel sagt eine Gruppe von Männern in Frankreich: Wir wollen jetzt schon etwas tun !
Diese Männer-Gruppe in Frankreich hat besondere Unterhosen gebastelt.
Diese Unterhosen sind eine Art Verhütungs-Mittel.
Denn die Unterhosen wärmen die Hoden.
Dadurch werden auch die Spermien warm.
Spermien vertragen keine Hitze.
Die Hitze schadet den Spermien.
So kann eine Schwangerschaft verhindert werden.
An Schulen fehlen Lehrer
An vielen Schulen in Deutschland fehlen Lehrer.
Sie werden oft durch Quer-Einsteiger ersetzt.
Ist das gut ?
Schulen in Deutschland haben ein Problem:
Sie haben zu wenige Lehrer.
In Deutschland fehlen ungefähr 40 Tausend Lehrer.
Das nennt man auch: Lehrer-Mangel.
Ein Grund für den Lehrer-Mangel ist, dass zu wenige Menschen eine Ausbildung zum Lehrer machen.
Schulen haben verschiedene Lösungen für den Lehrer-Mangel.
Zum Beispiel: • Es gibt weniger Unterricht für die Schüler. • Es gibt größere Schul-Klassen. • Es unterrichten wieder Lehrer, die bereits in Rente waren. • Es unterrichten angehende Lehrer, die noch keinen Berufs-Abschluss haben.
Oft wird auch diese Lösung ausprobiert:
Schulen stellen Quer-Einsteiger als Lehrer ein.
Quer-Einsteiger haben den Lehrer-Beruf nicht studiert.
Sie haben nur ein Fach studiert, zum Beispiel Geschichte, Deutsch oder Mathe.
Sie haben aber nicht gelernt, wie man Kinder und Jugendliche unterrichtet.
Sie haben nicht gelernt, wie man anderen etwas beibringt.
Viele Quer-Einsteiger machen deshalb eine Weiter-Bildung.
Sie lernen hier den Lehrer-Beruf.
Sie lernen, zu unterrichten und richtig mit Kindern und Jugendlichen umzugehen.
Man nennt das auch: pädagogische Ausbildung.
Unterschiedliche Meinungen zu Quer-Einsteigern
Es gibt unterschiedliche Meinungen zu Quer-Einsteigern.
Einige Menschen finden: Quer-Einsteiger sind toll für den Lehrer-Beruf.
Sie haben vielleicht schon woanders gearbeitet.
Sie haben vielleicht einen praktischen Blick auf ihre Fächer.
Sie bringen andere Erfahrungen mit als die anderen Lehrer.
Aber: Die Politik muss sich darum kümmern, dass die Quer-Einsteiger eine gute pädagogische Ausbildung bekommen.
Einige Menschen finden aber: Quer-Einsteiger sind auf Dauer keine Lösung für den Lehrer-Mangel.
In jedem Bundes-Land ist die Weiter-Bildung anders.
Nicht jede Weiter-Bildung hat eine gute Qualität.
Nicht immer sind Quer-Einsteiger danach für den Unterricht bereit.
Schulen brauchen gut ausgebildete Lehrer.
Außerdem werden seit ein paar Jahren wieder mehr Kinder in Deutschland geboren.
In Zukunft gibt es also mehr Schüler.
Und es werden noch mehr Lehrer gebraucht.
Die Politik muss sich endlich kümmern.
Sie muss den Lehrer-Beruf beliebter machen.
Sie muss dafür sorgen, dass mehr Menschen eine Ausbildung zum Lehrer machen.
Zum Beispiel durch mehr Studien-Plätze in der Lehrer-Ausbildung an den Universitäten.
Und durch eine bessere Bezahlung der fertig ausgebildeten Lehrer.
Deutschland verliert gegen Südkorea
Die deutsche Mannschaft scheidet aus der WM aus.
Schweden und Mexiko sind weiter im Achtel-Finale.
Deutschland scheidet aus der WM aus.
Die deutsche Mannschaft konnte nicht gegen Südkorea gewinnen.
Hier alle wichtigen Infos zum Spiel.
► Wie ging das Spiel aus ?
Deutschland schießt kein Tor.
Südkorea schießt 2 Tore.
Südkorea gewinnt.
► Wie war die Situation vor dem Spiel ?
Deutschland spielt in einer Gruppe mit Mexiko, Schweden und Südkorea.
Vor dem Spiel ist keine von den Mannschaften sicher weiter.
Alle Mannschaften können noch in das Achtel-Finale kommen.
Und alle Mannschaften können noch aus der WM ausscheiden.
Die deutsche Mannschaft will deshalb gegen Südkorea gewinnen.
Aber die deutsche Mannschaft ist auch unsicher.
► Wie lief das Spiel ab ?
In der ersten Halbzeit schießt keine Mannschaft ein Tor.
Deutschland hat öfter den Ball.
Aber Südkorea hat ein paar Chancen.
Auch im Spiel Mexiko gegen Schweden gibt es in der ersten Halbzeit keine Tore.
Deshalb ist noch alles möglich.
In der zweiten Halbzeit schießt Schweden 3 Tore gegen Mexiko.
Das heißt: Die deutsche Mannschaft muss gewinnen.
Sonst ist sie raus aus der WM.
Aber die deutschen Spieler machen viele Fehler.
Sie sind langsam.
In der Nachspielzeit schießt Südkorea 1 Tor.
Bei einer Ecke trifft der Südkoreaner Younggwon Kim.
Danach laufen alle deutschen Spieler nach vorne.
Auch der Torwart Manuel Neuer.
Das Tor steht frei.
Und der Südkoreaner Heungmin Son kann noch 1 Tor schießen.
Damit hat Südkorea am Ende von dem Spiel 2 Tore.
Die deutschen Spieler sind nach dem Spiel sehr enttäuscht.
Sie können jetzt nicht weiter in der WM spielen.
Deutschland ist die letzte Mannschaft in der Gruppe.
Südkorea kann auch nicht weiter in der WM spielen.
Schweden und Mexiko sind weiter im Achtel-Finale.
Wenn Medikamente nicht wirken
Kranke sterben oft, weil Medikamente nicht wirken.
Ein Grund sind bestimmte Keime.
Auf der Welt gibt es sehr viele Keime.
Was sind Keime ?
Keime sind Krankheits-Erreger.
Keime sieht man nicht mit dem bloßen Auge.
Keime sind in der Luft und im Wasser.
Keime können Menschen krank machen.
Zum Beispiel, wenn die Keime in eine Wunde gelangen.
Keime können mit Medikamenten behandelt werden.
Diese Medikamente heißen: Antibiotika.
Ein großes Problem ist: Es gibt immer mehr Keime, bei denen Antibiotika nicht wirken.
Man sagt dann: Diese Keime sind resistent.
Die Keime sind widerstandsfähig gegen Antibiotika.
Warum gibt es immer mehr widerstandsfähige Keime ?
Warum wirken die Antibiotika nicht ?
Ein Grund dafür ist: Deutsche Ärzte verschreiben große Mengen Antibiotika an kranke Menschen.
Die Keime sind deshalb immer öfter Antibiotika ausgesetzt.
Die Keime gewöhnen sich an diese Antibiotika.
Und die Keime entwickeln Abwehr-Kräfte gegen diese Antibiotika.
Die Folge davon ist: Antibiotika helfen nicht mehr gegen diese Keime.
Antibiotika heilen kranke Menschen nicht mehr.
An widerstandsfähigen Keimen sterben jedes Jahr 15000 Menschen in Deutschland.
Ein weiteres Problem ist: Widerstandsfähige Keime verbreiten sich schnell.
Sie verbreiten sich schnell in der Umwelt.
Kranke Menschen geben diese Keime weiter.
Und auch Tiere geben widerstandsfähige Keime weiter.
Wie geben Tiere widerstandsfähige Keime weiter ?
Rinder, Schweine und Hühner bekommen auf Bauern-Höfen oft Antibiotika.
Zum Beispiel gegen Krankheiten oder damit sie schneller wachsen.
Die Tiere entwickeln mit der Zeit ebenfalls widerstandsfähige Keime.
Über die Tier-Ausscheidungen gelangen die Keime in die Gülle.
Die Gülle wird zum Düngen der Felder benutzt.
Die Gülle wird dort vom Regen in Gewässer geleitet.
Zum Beispiel in Flüsse und Seen.
Der Fernsehsender NDR hat herausgefunden: In vielen deutschen Gewässern gibt es widerstandsfähige Keime.
Seehofers Plan zur Flüchtlings-Politik
Der Innen-Minister Horst Seehofer stellt einen Plan vor.
Er will weniger Flüchtlinge in Deutschland.
Horst Seehofer hat einen Plan vorgestellt.
Horst Seehofer ist von der Partei CSU.
Und er ist der deutsche Innen-Minister.
Seine Aufgaben sind zum Beispiel: • für die Sicherheit in Deutschland sorgen, also gegen Terrorismus und andere Straftaten vorgehen • Lösungen für Krisen finden, zum Beispiel nach Natur-Katastrophen
Was steht in dem Plan von Horst Seehofer ?
Horst Seehofer nennt seinen Plan: Masterplan.
In dem Plan geht es um die Flüchtlings-Politik.
Seit dem Jahr 2015 kommen viele Flüchtlinge nach Europa.
Viele Flüchtlinge kommen aus Syrien und Nord-Afrika.
Sie fliehen vor Verfolgung, Krieg und schlechten Lebens-Bedingungen.
Viele Flüchtlinge kommen auch nach Deutschland.
Sie beantragen hier Asyl.
Das Wort Asyl bedeutet Zuflucht.
Wenn Flüchtlinge Asyl bekommen, dann dürfen sie erst mal in Deutschland bleiben.
Das will Horst Seehofer mit seinem Plan ändern.
Horst Seehofer will: • Weniger Flüchtlinge sollen nach Deutschland kommen und hier bleiben können. • Und weniger Flüchtlinge sollen Asyl beantragen und Asyl bekommen können.
Dafür hat Horst Seehofer 63 Ziele festgelegt.
Hier sind einige dieser Zielen im Überblick:
Grenz-Kontrollen einführen
Laut dem Plan von Horst Seehofer soll an den deutschen Grenzen Folgendes passieren:
Die Grenzen sollen stärker bewacht werden.
Dafür soll die deutsche Polizei zusammen-arbeiten mit der Polizei aus den Nachbar-Ländern.
Sie sollen Flüchtlinge an den Grenzen aufhalten.
Auch die Grenzen von Europa sollen besser bewacht werden.
Viele Flüchtlinge kommen zum Beispiel in Booten über das Mittelmeer nach Spanien und Italien.
Viele von diesen Booten kommen aus Nord-Afrika.
Aber diese Boote mit Flüchtlingen sollen zurück nach Nord-Afrika geschickt werden.
Anker-Zentren einrichten
In dem Plan von Horst Seehofer steht außerdem: Über Asyl-Anträge soll schneller entschieden werden.
Es soll also schneller entschieden werden: Darf ein Flüchtling in Deutschland bleiben ?
Oder muss er zurück in sein Heimat-Land ?
Dafür sollen Flüchtlinge nach ihrer Ankunft in Deutschland in eine besondere Unterkunft kommen.
Horst Seehofer nennt diese Unterkunft Anker-Zentrum.
Das Wort Anker ist eine Abkürzung für: Ankunft, Entscheidung und Rückführung.
Im Anker-Zentrum sollen Flüchtlinge ihren Asyl-Antrag stellen.
Und der Asyl-Antrag soll schnell bearbeitet werden.
Dafür soll es in den Anker-Zentren alle notwendigen Behörden und Gerichte geben.
Transit-Zentren für Flüchtlinge
Viele Flüchtlinge wollen in Deutschland Asyl beantragen.
Aber einige Flüchtlinge haben schon Asyl beantragt.
Sie waren vorher schon in einem anderen EU-Land.
Dort wurden zuerst ihre Daten erfasst.
Und dann haben sie einen Asyl-Antrag gestellt.
Laut dem Plan von Horst Seehofer soll in diesen Fällen Folgendes passieren:
Diese Flüchtlinge kommen in eine besondere Unterkunft.
Horst Seehofer nennt diese Unterkunft Transit-Zentrum.
Das Wort Transit bezeichnet Orte, an denen man nur für kurze Zeit ist.
Flüchtlinge sollen in den Transit-Zentren für bis zu 48 Stunden bleiben.
Danach werden die Flüchtlinge in das EU-Land zurückgeschickt, in dem sie den 1. Asyl-Antrag gestellt haben.
Es ist aber noch nicht sicher, ob die anderen EU-Länder dabei mitmachen und diese Flüchtlinge wieder zurücknehmen.
Wie sind die Meinungen zum Plan von Horst Seehofer ?
Es gibt unterschiedliche Meinungen zu dem Plan.
Viele Ziele von Horst Seehofer werden kritisiert, besonders die Transit-Zentren und Grenz-Kontrollen.
Deshalb ist es noch nicht sicher, ob der Plan umgesetzt wird.
Welche Kritik gibt es genau ?
Viele Menschen finden den Plan von Horst Seehofer unmenschlich.
Flüchtlings- und Hilfs-Organisationen sagen zum Beispiel: Flüchtlinge fliehen oft vor Verfolgung und Krieg.
Sie brauchen dringend Hilfe.
Abweisung und Grenz-Kontrollen helfen Flüchtlingen nicht.
Das macht die Situation für Flüchtlinge nur noch schlimmer.
Eine weitere Kritik lautet: Horst Seehofer hat seinen Plan nicht gut abgesprochen.
Politiker von den Parteien CDU und SPD sagen: Horst Seehofer hat seinen Plan nicht mit uns abgesprochen.
Warum ist das wichtig ?
Die Parteien CDU und SPD sind mit der CSU in einer Regierung.
Die 3 Parteien entscheiden gemeinsam über die deutsche Politik.
Horst Seehofer darf also nicht alleine über die Flüchtlings-Politik entscheiden.
Vertrag von CDU, CSU und SPD
Die Parteien CDU, CSU und SPD wollen zusammen in Deutschland regieren.
Deshalb haben die Parteien einen Vertrag gemacht.
Die Parteien CDU, CSU und SPD haben bei der Bundestags-Wahl viele Stimmen bekommen.
Die Parteien haben zusammen mehr als die Hälfte der Stimmen.
CDU, CSU und SPD können deshalb eine Regierung bilden.
Diese Parteien bestimmen dann die Politik in Deutschland.
Wenn mehrere Parteien eine Regierung bilden, nennt man das auch: Koalition.
Bevor die Parteien zusammen eine Koalition bilden, sprechen sie über viele wichtige Themen.
Sie sprechen über ihre Ziele für die nächsten 4 Jahre.
Sie schreiben die Ziele in einen Koalitions-Vertrag.
Der Koalitions-Vertrag von CDU, CSU und SPD ist jetzt fertig.
Viele Mitglieder in der SPD sind unzufrieden mit dem Koalitions-Vertrag.
Sie finden: Im Koalitions-Vertrag stehen zu wenige Ziele, die für die SPD wichtig sind.
Die SPD-Mitglieder wollen deshalb über den Koalitions-Vertrag abstimmen.
Wenn über die Hälfte der Mitglieder gegen den Vertrag stimmt, gibt es keine Koalition von CDU, CSU und SPD.
Was steht im Koalitions-Vertrag von CDU, CSU und SPD ?
CDU, CSU und SPD haben über viele Themen verhandelt.
Der Koalitions-Vertrag ist sehr lang.
Er ist 177 Seiten lang.
Im Koalitions-Vertrag geht es zum Beispiel um diese Themen:
• Bildung
• Pflege
• Arbeit
• Wohnen
• Internet
Was steht im Koalitions-Vertrag zum Thema Bildung ?
Ein Ziel ist: CDU, CSU und SPD wollen mehr Geld für Bildung ausgeben.
Sie wollen Schulen ausbauen.
Wie wollen sie die Schulen ausbauen ?
Es soll mehr Ganztags-Schulen geben.
Das bedeutet: Mehr Schüler werden den ganzen Tag in der Schule betreut.
Dann können beide Elternteile den ganzen Tag arbeiten.
Das ist vor allem für viele Mütter ein Vorteil.
Sie bleiben bisher oft am Nachmittag Zuhause, um ihre Kinder zu betreuen.
Außerdem soll es für Schulen mehr Computer geben.
Die Computer sollen den Schul-Unterricht erleichtern.
Und sie sollen die Schüler auf die Arbeit mit Computern im Berufsleben vorbereiten.
Was steht im Koalitions-Vertrag zum Thema Pflege ?
Ein Ziel ist: CDU, CSU und SPD wollen 8000 neue Arbeits-Plätze in der Pflege schaffen.
Viele Menschen kümmern sich um kranke und ältere Menschen.
Das nennt man: Pflege.
Aktuell gibt es nicht genug Menschen, die als Pflege-Kräfte arbeiten.
CDU, CSU und SPD wollen, dass mehr Menschen in der Pflege arbeiten.
Was steht im Koalitions-Vertrag zum Thema Arbeit ?
Ein Arbeits-Vertrag gibt Menschen eine Sicherheit im Beruf.
Die Menschen wissen dann, wie viel Geld sie bekommen und wie lange sie arbeiten.
Viele Menschen haben einen befristeten Arbeits-Vertrag.
Ein befristeter Arbeits-Vertrag gilt nur für eine festgelegte Zeit.
Die Menschen wissen nicht, was danach mit ihrem Arbeits-Platz passiert.
Sie haben wenig Sicherheit in ihrem Beruf.
Gegen befristete Arbeits-Verträge wollen die CDU und die CSU nicht viel tun.
Die SPD kann sich hier nicht durchsetzen.
Die SPD kann befristete Arbeits-Verträge nicht abschaffen.
Was steht im Koalitions-Vertrag zum Thema Wohnen ?
Ein Ziel ist: CDU, CSU und SPD wollen Vermieter daran hindern, die Mieten stark zu erhöhen.
Warum ?
Viele Vermieter wollen durch Bauarbeiten in der Wohnung eine höhere Miete bekommen.
Die Vermieter sagen dann zum Mieter: Die Wohnung ist durch die Bauarbeiten besser und moderner.
Also wird auch die Miete höher.
Viele Menschen haben dann Probleme, weil ihre Wohnung immer mehr Miete kostet.
Und sie nicht genug Geld dafür haben.
Was steht im Koalitions-Vertrag zum Thema Internet ?
Viele Menschen machen sich Sorgen um den Schutz von Daten im Internet.
Daten sind zum Beispiel Fotos und E-Mail-Adressen.
Daten können ohne Erlaubnis weitergeben werden.
Viele Menschen fordern deshalb strengere Gesetze für den Schutz von Daten.
In Europa gibt es bald neue Gesetze zum Schutz von Daten.
Die Gesetze gelten dann auch in Deutschland.
CDU, CSU und SPD wollen die Gesetze weiterentwickeln.
Sie nutzen dafür auch die Hilfe von Fachleuten.
Sollen Büchereien sonntags öffnen ?
Büchereien sind Orte für Begegnungen.
Am Sonntag sind Büchereien aber zu.
Muss sich das ändern ?
In Deutschland gibt es viele öffentliche Büchereien.
"Öffentlich" bedeutet: Alle Menschen können in die Bücherei gehen.
Alle können Büchereien zur Bildung nutzen.
Alle bekommen einen Bücherei-Ausweis.
Alle können sich: Bücher, Zeitschriften, CDs oder DVDs ausleihen.
Land-Kreise, Städte oder Gemeinden geben Büchereien dafür Geld.
Die taz spricht mit Kirsten Kappert-Gonther über Büchereien.
Frau Kappert-Gonther ist Psychologin.
Sie beschäftigt sich mit seelischen Erkrankungen.
Sie fragt sich zum Beispiel: Welchen Einfluss haben Büchereien auf seelische Erkrankungen ?
Büchereien auch am Sonntag öffnen
Frau Kappert-Gonther sagt über Büchereien: Büchereien sollen auch am Sonntag öffnen.
Warum ?
Viele Menschen gehen nicht nur wegen der Bücher in die Bücherei.
Frau Kappert-Gonther sagt: Viele Menschen sind einsam.
Sie sind vor allem am Wochenende einsam.
Für viele Menschen ist die Bücherei ein Ort für Begegnungen.
In der Bücherei treffen sie auf ganz unterschiedliche Menschen.
Zum Beispiel auf: • Schüler und Studenten • Senioren • Obdachlose • Flüchtlinge • Familien
Frau Kappert-Gonther findet deshalb: Büchereien sollen auch am Sonntag öffnen.
Büchereien sollen auch am Sonntag ein Ort für Begegnungen sein.
Frau Kappert-Gonther hat etwas ausprobiert.
Sie hat mit einer Bremer Bücherei einen Test gemacht.
Sie haben die Bremer Bücherei auch am Sonntag geöffnet.
Und sie haben verschiedene Orte in der Bücherei eingerichtet:
• ruhige Räume, in denen man alleine sein kann
• Tische für mehrere Leute, an denen man gemeinsam sitzen kann
Es ist still in der Bücherei.
Aber es ist auch laut.
Es ist eine gute Mischung.
Vielen Bücherei-Besuchern hat das gefallen.
Wer arbeitet am Sonntag ?
Ein Problem bei der Idee von Frau Kappert-Gonther ist aber: Bücherei-Mitarbeiter haben am Sonntag frei.
Sie dürfen am Sonntag nicht arbeiten.
Ein Gesetz in Deutschland verbietet das.
Die Frage ist also: Wer arbeitet am Sonntag in der Bücherei ?
Wer räumt die Bücher in die Regale ?
Wer verleiht die Bücher ?
Wer passt auf ?
Die Bücherei kann nur am Sonntag öffnen, wenn die Mitarbeiter sagen: Wir arbeiten freiwillig am Sonntag.
Frau Kappert-Gonther sagt: Einige Mitarbeiter in der Bremer Bücherei haben das gemacht.
Sie haben freiwillig am Sonntag gearbeitet.
Das hat gut geklappt.
Auch andere deutsche Büchereien möchten am Sonntag öffnen.
Aber das Gesetz macht das schwierig.
Frau Kappert-Gonther sucht deshalb nach einer Lösung.
Sie ist nicht nur Psychologin.
Sie ist auch eine Politikerin.
Sie ist Mitglied im Bundestag für die Partei "Die Grünen".
Hier setzt sie sich auch für eine Änderung des Arbeitszeiten-Gesetzes ein.
Sie findet: Das Gesetz soll erlauben, dass Bücherei-Mitarbeiter am Sonntag arbeiten dürfen.
Und dass Büchereien am Sonntag öffnen können.
Wie will Frau Kappert-Gonther das erreichen ?
Sie will zum Beispiel mit den Gewerkschaften über die Arbeits-Zeiten sprechen.
Gewerkschaften setzen sich für die Rechte von Arbeitnehmern ein.
Auch für die Rechte von Bücherei-Mitarbeitern.
Gewerkschaften wollen verhindern, dass Arbeit am Sonntag erlaubt wird.
In Gesprächen will Frau Kappert-Gonther Gewerkschaften, Politiker und weitere Büchereien von ihrer Idee überzeugen.
Sie hofft, dass sie so im Bundestag eine Gesetzes-Änderung erreicht.
Und Büchereien auch am Sonntag ein Ort für Begegnungen sind.
Ist das zu viel Nachspielzeit ?
Bei der Fußball-WM 2018 gibt es oft lange Nachspielzeiten.
Wie gerecht ist das ?
Bei der WM 2018 ist eine Sache sehr auffällig:
Es gibt bei den Fußball-Spielen besonders viel Nachspielzeit.
Die Spiele dauern manchmal bis zu 9 Minuten länger.
Unsere 2 taz-Autoren haben zur Nachspielzeit sehr verschiedene Meinungen.
taz-Autor Jaris Lanzendörfer findet: Nachspielzeit macht das Spiel gerechter !
Und taz-Autorin Doris Akrap findet: Nachspielzeit ist was für Langweiler !
Aber was ist die Nachspielzeit eigentlich ?
Die Regeln dazu lauten so:
Das Fußball-Spiel dauert normalerweise 90 Minuten.
Doch oft werden Fußball-Spiele zwischendurch unterbrochen.
Zum Beispiel:
• wenn sich ein Spieler verletzt
• wenn ein Spieler ausgewechselt wird
In diesen Momenten unterbricht der Schiedsrichter das Spiel.
Es geht also Zeit verloren.
Die Zeit wird am Spiel-Ende nachgeholt.
Das Spiel dauert dann ein paar Minuten länger.
Das nennt man Nachspielzeit.
Der Schiedsrichter entscheidet, wie viel Nachspielzeit es gibt.
taz-Autor Jaris Lanzendörfer findet: Nachspielzeit macht das Spiel gerechter !
Er nennt ein Beispiel:
2 Fußball-Mannschaften spielen gegeneinander.
Wir nennen sie hier Mannschaft A und Mannschaft B.
Das Spiel ist bald zu Ende und Mannschaft A führt gegen Mannschaft B.
Mannschaft A hat also gute Chancen auf den Sieg.
Dann passiert bei Fußball-Spielen oft dasselbe.
Damit Mannschaft A ihre Führung behält, arbeitet sie nun mit einen Trick:
Sie verschwendet absichtlich Zeit.
Das macht Mannschaft A zum Beispiel so:
• Sie spielt langsamer bei Einwürfen, Eckbällen und Abstößen vorm Tor.
• Sie wechselt öfter Spieler aus.
• Oder sie täuscht Verletzungen vor.
Das alles unterbricht das Spiel.
Und das alles verbraucht viel Spielzeit.
Diese Spielzeit fehlt Mannschaft B, um Tore zu schießen und den Rückstand aufzuholen.
Jaris Lanzendörfer findet: Solche Verschwendungen von Spielzeit gibt es bei der WM öfter.
Die verschwendete Zeit muss nachgeholt werden.
Mehr Nachspielzeit ist deshalb gerecht !
Die Mannschaft im Rückstand kann in der Nachspielzeit noch Tore schießen.
Bei der WM gab es in der Nachspielzeit einige wichtige Tore.
Zum Beispiel beim Spiel Deutschland gegen Schweden.
Hier schoss der deutsche Spieler Toni Kroos das entscheidende Tor erst in der 95. Minute.
Hier ist ein Foto von dem Tor:
Oder beim Spiel England gegen Tunesien.
Hier schoss der englische Spieler Harry Kane das entscheidende Tor erst in der 91. Minute.
Hier ist ein Foto von dem Tor:
taz-Autorin Doris Akrap findet: Nachspielzeit ist was für Langweiler !
Sie sagt: Zeit zu verschwenden ist in Ordnung.
Auch im Fußball.
Auch Fußball-Spieler dürfen im Spiel mal trödeln.
Sie dürfen mal durch die Gegend gucken.
Sie dürfen sich mal Zeit für den Einwurf oder Freistoß lassen.
Sie müssen nicht die ganzen 90 Minuten laufen.
Kleine Verschnauf-Pausen sind wichtig, denn Fußball-Spieler sind schließlich keine Roboter.
Kurz gesagt:
Die Nachspielzeit passt nicht zum Fußball.
Denn beim Fußball geht es nicht nur darum jeden Moment von der Spielzeit optimal zu nutzen.
Wer will so eine Fußball-WM sehen ?
So eine Fußball-WM wäre total öde.
Beim Fußball geht es um etwas anderes:
Es geht um Einsatz !
Es geht um Leidenschaft !
Und ja, manchmal klaut eine Mannschaft einer anderen Mannschaft dabei die Zeit.
Aber so ist Fußball eben:
Einer gewinnt, einer verliert.
Und es gibt immer noch den Schiedsrichter.
Er kann einschreiten.
Er kann pfeifen bei langsamen Auswechslungen und vorgetäuschten Verletzungen.
Und er muss schon im Spiel handeln !
Anstatt alles auf die Nachspielzeit zu verschieben.
Gesetz gegen Zucker in Getränken
Zu viel Zucker kann uns krank machen.
Kann eine Zucker-Steuer helfen ?
In vielen Getränken ist viel Zucker, zum Beispiel in Coca-Cola.
Viele Menschen trinken gern Getränke wie Coca-Cola.
Aber was passiert, wenn Menschen zu viel Zucker essen oder trinken ?
Sie können krank werden.
Sie können zum Beispiel Übergewicht bekommen.
Oder sie können die Krankheit Diabetes bekommen.
Die Regierung im Land Großbritannien will verhindern, dass Menschen durch Zucker krank werden.
Deshalb hat sie ein Gesetz gemacht.
Das Gesetz bestimmt, dass es eine Zucker-Steuer für Getränke geben soll.
Das bedeutet: Getränke mit viel Zucker sind jetzt teurer.
Die Regierung in Großbritannien hofft: Wenn diese Getränke teurer sind, kaufen sich die Menschen weniger von diesen Getränken.
Oder Getränke-Hersteller wie Coca-Cola verwenden weniger Zucker bei der Herstellung der Getränke.
Wie ist das in Deutschland geregelt ?
In Deutschland gibt es keine Zucker-Steuer.
Aber warum nicht ?
Die Regierung in Deutschland sagt: Getränke-Hersteller sollen freiwillig weniger Zucker verwenden.
Auch Coca-Cola soll freiwillig weniger Zucker verwenden.
Es soll kein Gesetz dafür geben.
Aber auch in Deutschland essen und trinken die Menschen zu viel Zucker.
Auch hier werden Menschen dadurch krank.
Ein Gesetz kann das vielleicht ändern.
Es gibt aber auch andere Möglichkeiten.
Die Regierung kann auch für bessere Informationen sorgen.
Sie kann dafür sorgen, dass die Menschen genau wissen: • Wie viel Zucker ist in Getränken wie Coca-Cola ? • Wie viel Zucker darf man am Tag essen oder trinken ? • Was ist gesunde Ernährung ? • Was sind die Folgen von ungesunder Ernährung ?
Denn die meisten Menschen kennen nicht die richtigen Antworten auf diese Fragen.
Gibt es eine andere Wahl als Zucker in Getränken ?
Getränke können auch ohne Zucker süß schmecken.
Aber wie geht das ?
Getränke-Firmen können auch Süß-Stoffe verwenden.
Coca-Cola zum Beispiel verwendet auch Süß-Stoffe für Getränke.
Süß-Stoffe schmecken oft sogar süßer als Zucker.
Aber auch Süß-Stoffe können schädlich sein.
Denn Süß-Stoffe täuschen dem Körper etwas vor.
Durch die Süß-Stoffe glaubt der Körper: Jetzt gibt es etwas Süßes mit vielen Kalorien.
Zucker hat viele Kalorien.
Aber Süß-Stoffe haben fast keine Kalorien.
Wenn der Körper nur noch Getränke mit Süß-Stoff bekommt, will der Körper die Kalorien von woanders.
Der Körper will dann zum Beispiel Süßigkeiten.
Und zu viele Süßigkeiten sind ungesund.
Deshalb sollte man süße Nahrungsmittel und süße Getränke nicht zu oft und nicht zu viel essen und trinken.
Dabei ist es egal, ob bei diesen Nahrungsmitteln und Getränken Zucker oder Süß-Stoffe verwendet wurde.
Medien-Berichte über Minderheiten
Die Medien verwenden zu oft Vorurteile, wenn sie über Menschen mit Behinderungen und Menschen mit Migrations-Hintergrund berichten.
Medien wie Zeitungen, Radio und Fernsehen haben ein Problem:
Sie verwenden in ihren Berichten zu oft Vorurteile, wenn sie über Minderheiten berichten.
Vorurteile stehen zum Beispiel oft in Berichten über: • Menschen mit Behinderungen • Menschen mit Migrations-Hintergrund
Das sind Menschen, die selbst aus einem anderen Land kommen.
Oder ihre Eltern oder Großeltern kommen aus einem anderen Land.
Wie berichten die Medien über Menschen mit Behinderungen ?
Die Medien berichten oft mitleidig und zu bewundernd über Menschen mit Behinderungen.
Sie schreiben zum Beispiel: • Menschen schaffen etwas "trotz" ihrer Behinderung. • Sie arbeiten "trotz" ihrer Behinderung. • Sie sind verheiratet "trotz" ihrer Behinderung. • Sie machen Sport "trotz" ihrer Behinderung.
Hier stehen nicht die Menschen selbst im Mittelpunkt, sondern nur ihre Behinderung.
So kann schnell der Eindruck entstehen: Alle Menschen mit Behinderungen leiden.
Für sie ist ihre Behinderung eine Einschränkung oder ein Problem.
Aber das stimmt nicht.
Wie berichten die Medien über Menschen mit Migrations-Hintergrund ?
Die Medien berichten oft einseitig über Menschen mit Migrations-Hintergrund.
Sie berichten öfter über schlechte Dinge als über gute Dinge.
Zum Beispiel berichten die Medien viel über Straftaten von Menschen mit Migrations-Hintergrund.
Dabei wird betont, dass der Täter einen Migrations-Hintergrund hat.
Auch hier stehen nicht die Menschen selbst im Mittelpunkt, sondern nur ihr Migrations-Hintergrund.
So kann schnell der Eindruck entstehen: Alle Menschen mit Migrations-Hintergrund sind kriminell.
Aber das stimmt nicht.
Menschen sind mehr als nur eine Eigenschaft
Bei den Berichten steht oft nur eine Eigenschaft im Vordergrund, nämlich die Behinderung oder der Migrations-Hintergrund.
Diese Darstellung ist zu einseitig.
Warum ?
In Deutschland leben 7,5 Millionen Menschen mit Behinderungen und 19 Millionen Menschen mit Migrations-Hintergrund.
Jeder dieser Menschen geht mit seiner Behinderung oder mit seinem Migrations-Hintergrund anders um.
Jeder von ihnen führt ein anderes Leben.
Sie haben viele verschiedene Eigenschaften, zum Beispiel: • verschiedene Berufe • verschiedene Interessen • verschiedene Erfahrungen • verschiedene Familien und Freunde
Menschen mit Behinderungen und Migrations-Hintergrund dürfen deshalb nicht auf eine Eigenschaft beschränkt werden.
Wieso berichten Medien oft mit Vorurteilen ?
Bei den Medien arbeiten viele Journalisten.
Journalisten spricht man so aus:
Dschur-na-lis-ten.
Viele Journalisten in Deutschland haben keine Behinderung und keinen Migrations-Hintergrund.
Deshalb kennen sie sich damit oft nicht gut aus.
Sie wissen oft nicht: • Wie wollen Menschen mit Behinderungen dargestellt werden ? • Und wie Menschen mit Migrations-Hintergrund ?
Das muss sich ändern.
Bei den Medien müssen ganz unterschiedliche Journalisten arbeiten.
Wie sollten Medien berichten ?
Die Berichte von Medien müssen vielfältiger werden.
Medien können über Gutes berichten.
Sie können über Schlechtes berichten.
Sie können über den Alltag von Menschen berichten.
Sie können über viele verschiedene Themen berichten:
Berufe, Interessen, sportliche und künstlerische Leistungen.
Dabei müssen Behinderung und Migrations-Hintergrund nicht immer im Mittelpunkt stehen.
Es sollte einen guten Ausgleich bei der Bericht-Erstattung geben.
Wir sprechen über Europa !
Im April 2019 findet das "taz lab" statt.
Das "taz lab" ist eine große Veranstaltung mit spannenden Gesprächen und Vorträgen.
Diesmal geht es um das Thema Europa.
Die Zeitung "taz" macht einmal im Jahr das "taz lab".
Das "taz lab" ist eine große Veranstaltung.
Zu der Veranstaltung kommen viele Menschen.
Zum Beispiel Politiker, Journalisten und Fachleute.
Sie sprechen über aktuelle und wichtige Themen.
Das Thema in diesem Jahr lautet Europa.
Denn im Mai gibt es in Europa wichtige Wahlen.
Es gibt Wahlen in der ganzen Europäischen Union, kurz EU.
EU-Bürger aller EU-Länder können dabei ihre Stimme abgeben.
Man nennt diese Wahlen Europa-Wahlen.
Wer wird bei den Europa-Wahlen gewählt ?
Die EU-Bürger wählen die Mitglieder vom Europäischen Parlament.
Das Europäische Parlament hat wichtige Aufgaben in der EU.
Zum Beispiel: • Es prüft und genehmigt Gesetze. • Es prüft und genehmigt die EU-Ausgaben, also wie viel Geld die EU ausgeben darf.
Auf dem "taz lab" sprechen wir viel über Europa-Politik.
Wir wollen dabei gute Antworten finden.
Zum Beispiel auf diese Fragen:
• Welche Politik soll es in Europa geben ?
• Wie sollen die Länder zusammenarbeiten ?
• Wie wollen die Menschen in Europa leben ?
• Wie geht man gemeinsam mit Problemen um ?
Aktuell hat die EU einige Probleme.
Beim "taz lab" sprechen wir auch darüber.
Zum Beispiel über diese 3 Probleme:
1. Rechte Parteien werden in der EU immer stärker.
Immer mehr EU-Bürger wählen rechte Parteien.
Rechte Parteien fordern zum Beispiel eine strenge Flüchtlings-Politik.
Viele rechte Parteien wollen die Länder-Grenzen schließen.
Dann können vielleicht weniger Flüchtlinge nach Europa kommen.
Beim taz lab wird gefragt: Wieso werden rechte Parteien stärker ?
Was kann man dagegen tun ?
Wie verhindert man geschlossene Grenzen ?
Wie bleibt Europa offen ?
2. Großbritannien ist seit 46 Jahren EU-Mitglied.
Nun will das Land aus der EU austreten.
Aktuell verhandelt die EU mit Großbritannien über den Austritt.
Beim taz lab wird gefragt: Warum verlässt Großbritannien die EU ?
Wollen bald noch mehr Länder die EU verlassen ?
3. Die EU-Länder halten oft nicht zusammen.
Zum Beispiel in den Jahren 2015 und 2016.
Damals kamen viele Flüchtlinge in die EU.
Einige EU-Länder haben Flüchtlinge aufgenommen.
Andere EU-Länder haben das nicht gemacht.
Beim taz lab wird gefragt: Warum halten die EU-Länder nicht zusammen ?
Wie kann man das ändern ?
Wie arbeitet man in Krisen besser zusammen ?
All diese Probleme machen klar: Die EU ist nicht perfekt.
Und vielleicht wird die EU nie perfekt sein.
Aber die Mitglieder der EU setzen sich immer noch für wichtige Ideen ein:
• Frieden in Europa
• Zusammenarbeit der Länder
• offene Grenzen
• eine gleichberechtigte Gesellschaft
• alle EU-Bürger können arbeiten und leben, wo sie möchten
Die EU bedeutet Sicherheit für viele Menschen, auch für Menschen außerhalb der EU.
Andere Länder wollen Teil der EU werden.
Viele Menschen suchen Zuflucht in der EU.
Beim "taz lab" sprechen wir deshalb darüber, wie man diese Ideen noch besser umsetzen kann.
Sie haben Meinungen oder Ideen zum Thema Europa ?
Oder wollen Sie sich informieren ?
Kommen Sie zum "taz lab" !
Wann ?
Am 6. April 2019, ab 8:30 Uhr
Wo ?
Im und um das taz-Haus, Friedrichstraße 21, 10969 Berlin
Eintritts-Karten gibt es hier:

Deutschland gewinnt gegen Schweden
Die deutsche Mannschaft scheidet noch nicht bei der WM aus.
Sie gewinnt das Spiel gegen Schweden.
Die deutsche Mannschaft ist erleichtert.
Sie muss noch nicht aus der WM ausscheiden.
► Wie geht das Spiel aus ?
Schweden schießt 1 Tor.
Deutschland schießt 2 Tore.
Deutschland gewinnt.
► Was passiert im Spiel ?
Deutschland hat das letzte Spiel gegen Mexiko verloren.
Die deutsche Mannschaft will deshalb unbedingt gegen Schweden gewinnen.
Sie rennt sofort vor das schwedische Tor.
In den ersten 10 Spiel-Minuten gibt es mehrere Tor-Chancen für Deutschland.
Aber die deutsche Mannschaft macht dieselben Fehler wie im Spiel gegen Mexiko.
Sie macht oft Fehler im Mittel-Feld und Fehler in der Abwehr.
Die schwedische Mannschaft macht deshalb das erste Tor.
Ihr Tor fällt in der 32. Minute vom Spiel.
Wie reagiert die deutsche Mannschaft auf das Tor von Schweden ?
Jogi Löw ist sauer.
Er ist der deutsche Trainer.
Nach dem Tor von Schweden schaut Jogi Löw als möchte er was kaputt machen, um seine Wut rauszulassen.
Hier ist ein Bild vom wütenden Jogi Löw:
Nach einer Pause beginnt die zweite Halb-Zeit.
Schweden liegt immer noch mit einem Tor vorne.
Doch dann verändert sich das Spiel.
Die schwedische Mannschaft spielt weiterhin gut.
Doch auch die deutsche Mannschaft will weiterhin gewinnen.
Die deutschen Spieler rennen wieder vor das schwedische Tor.
Auch der deutsche Stürmer Marco Reus rennt vor das schwedische Tor.
Und er triff in der 48. Minute vom Spiel.
Er macht ein Tor für die deutsche Mannschaft.
Hier ein Bild vom Tor von Marco Reus:
Nach dem Tor passiert lange nichts wichtiges.
Erst gegen Spiel-Ende passiert wieder etwas.
In der 82. Minute muss ein deutscher Spieler das Fußball-Feld verlassen.
Der Spieler heißt Jérôme Boateng.
Warum muss er den Platz verlassen ?
Er hat einen schwedischen Spieler am Spiel behindert und verletzt.
Hier ist ein Foto von diesem Moment:
Deutschland muss mit 10 Spielern zuende spielen.
Die deutsche Mannschaft hat also einen Spieler weniger als die schwedische Mannschaft.
Trotzdem hat die deutsche Mannschaft am Spiel-Ende eine Tor-Chance.
Der deutsche Spieler Toni Kroos schießt auf das schwedische Tor.
Und er trifft.
Die deutsche Mannschaft gewinnt das Spiel gegen Schweden.
► Was bedeutet der Sieg für die deutsche Mannschaft ?
Der Sieg bedeutet erstmal noch gar nichts.
Deutschland ist noch nicht weiter.
Die deutsche Mannschaft muss erst noch gegen Südkorea spielen.
Bisher ist das Spiel von der deutschen Mannschaft echt schwach.
Die deutsche Mannschaft verliert vielleicht gegen Südkorea.
Dann heißt es: Deutschland ist draußen !
Die deutsche Mannschaft fährt nach Hause !
Werbung für Schwangerschafts-Abbrüche
Eine Ärztin hat im Internet über Schwangerschafts-Abbrüche informiert.
Ein Gericht hat sie dafür verurteilt.
Im deutschen Straf-Gesetz gibt es den Paragrafen 219a.
In diesem Paragrafen steht: Ärzte dürfen keine Werbung machen für Schwangerschafts-Abbrüche.
Und Ärzte dürfen nicht öffentlich sagen, dass sie Schwangerschafts-Abbrüche anbieten.
Mit diesem Gesetz soll verhindert werden, dass Schwangerschafts-Abbrüche in unserer Gesellschaft als normal gelten.
In Deutschland darf eine Frau ihre Schwangerschaft bis zur 12. Schwangerschafts-Woche abbrechen.
Vor dem Abbruch muss die Frau zu einer Beratung gehen.
Nach der Beratung muss die Frau 3 Tage lang über den Schwangerschafts-Abbruch nachdenken.
Erst dann darf die Frau die Schwangerschaft abbrechen.
Es gibt zum Beispiel diese Gründe für einen Schwangerschafts-Abbruch:
● Die Frau fühlt sich nicht bereit für ein Kind.
● Die Frau ist in einer schlechten finanziellen Situation.
● Die Frau wurde vergewaltigt und ist dabei schwanger geworden.
● Die Gesundheit der Frau ist durch die Schwangerschaft gefährdet.
Aber oft fehlen den betroffenen Frauen Informationen wie: Welcher Arzt macht Schwangerschafts-Abbrüche ?
Welche Arten von Schwangerschafts-Abbrüchen gibt es ?
Der Fall Kristina Hänel
Eine Ärztin hat im Jahr 2017 auf ihrer Internet-Seite Informationen zu Schwangerschafts-Abbrüchen veröffentlicht.
Dabei hat die Ärztin auch erklärt, dass sie Schwangerschafts-Abbrüche macht.
Ein Gericht hat die Ärztin dafür verurteilt.
Sie soll jetzt eine Geldstrafe von 6000 Euro zahlen.
Die Ärztin heißt Kristina Hänel.
Die Zeitung taz hat über den Fall Kristina Hänel berichtet.
Die taz hat sogar eine Titelseite dazu gemacht.
Auf der Titelseite sind Fotos von vielen Ärztinnen und Ärzten.
Sie alle stehen auf der Seite von Kristina Hänel.
Sie möchten ihre Kollegin unterstützen.
Die Überschrift lautet: Wir machen Schwangerschafts-Abbrüche !
In einem Artikel in der taz sagen die Ärztinnen und Ärzte: Kristina Hänel hat keinen Fehler gemacht.
Sie hat keine Werbung für Schwangerschafts-Abbrüche gemacht.
Sie hat nur Informationen darüber veröffentlicht.
Und diese Informationen sind wichtig für Frauen.
Ein paar Ärztinnen und Ärzte von der taz-Titelseite haben jetzt eine Anzeige bekommen.
Sie müssen vielleicht vor Gericht, weil sie öffentlich gesagt haben: Wir machen Schwangerschafts-Abbrüche.
Aber: Manche von den Ärztinnen und Ärzten haben schon lange keinen Schwangerschafts-Abbruch mehr gemacht.
Einige sind sogar schon in Rente.
Die Ärztinnen und Ärzte haben keine Werbung für Schwangerschafts-Abbrüche gemacht.
Die Ärztinnen und Ärzte wurden aus diesem Grund angezeigt:
Sie unterstützen Kristina Hänel.
Was sagt der Bundestag zum Paragrafen 219a ?
Viele Menschen wollen den Paragrafen 219a abschaffen.
Deshalb beschäftigt sich jetzt auch der Bundestag mit dem Paragrafen 219a.
Was wollen die Parteien im Bundestag ?
Diese Parteien wollen den Paragrafen abschaffen:
● Bündnis 90 / Die Grünen
● Die Linke
● SPD
Die FDP will den Paragrafen ändern.
Diese Parteien wollen den Paragrafen nicht ändern:
● CDU
● CSU
● AfD
Familien-Nachzug für Flüchtlinge
Viele Flüchtlinge wollen ihre Familie nach Deutschland nachholen.
Die deutsche Regierung macht das schwer.
In den letzten 3 Jahren sind viele Flüchtlinge nach Deutschland gekommen.
Viele Flüchtlinge sind vor Krieg und Verfolgung geflohen.
Viele Flüchtlinge sind alleine nach Deutschland geflohen.
Sie wollen nun ihre Familien nach Deutschland holen.
Das nennt man auch: Familien-Nachzug.
Im Jahr 2016 hat die deutsche Regierung aber gesagt: Zu viele Flüchtlinge kommen nach Deutschland.
Deshalb wurde bei einigen Flüchtlingen der Familien-Nachzug gestoppt.
Bei welchen Flüchtlingen wurde Familien-Nachzug gestoppt ?
Viele Flüchtlinge bekommen in Deutschland einen Schutz-Status.
Aber nicht alle Flüchtlinge bekommen denselben Schutz-Status.
Einige Flüchtlinge bekommen einen eingeschränkten Schutz-Status.
Sie dürfen erstmal nur für 1 Jahr in Deutschland bleiben.
Man sagt dazu auch: sub-si-di-är-er Schutz.
Für Flüchtlinge mit so einem Schutz-Status war der Familien-Nachzug gestoppt.
Der Familien-Nachzug war für 2 Jahre gestoppt.
2 Jahre lang konnten diese Flüchtlinge ihre Familien nicht sehen.
Ab August 2018 dürfen diese Flüchtlinge ihre Familien wieder nach Deutschland holen.
Das gilt auch, wenn ihr Schutz-Status eingeschränkt ist.
Bei dem Familien-Nachzug gibt es aber Regeln.
Die deutsche Regierung sagt: Jeden Monat dürfen nur 1000 Familien-Mitglieder von Flüchtlingen nach Deutschland nachkommen.
Die deutschen Behörden wählen aus, wer nachkommen darf.
Flüchtlinge haben bei der Auswahl unterschiedlich gute Chancen.
Welche Flüchtlinge haben gute Chancen, ihre Familie nachzuholen ?
Das sind zum Beispiel: • Flüchtlinge mit einer Arbeit. • Flüchtlinge, die ihre Familie selbst versorgen können • Flüchtlinge, die gut Deutsch sprechen können.
Kritik an der Auswahl
Einige Politiker kritisieren diese Auswahl.
Warum ?
Für viele Flüchtlinge ist es schwer, in ein neues Land zu kommen.
Viele Flüchtlinge müssen erst die Sprache lernen.
Außerdem wird ihre berufliche Ausbildung in Deutschland oft nicht anerkannt.
Dann ist es schwer, schnell eine Arbeit zu finden.
Einige Politiker fordern deshalb: Auch wenn Flüchtlinge keine Arbeit haben, sollen sie ihre Familien nachholen können.
Auch wenn sie nicht genug Geld haben, sollen sie ihre Familien nachholen können.
Welche Familien-Mitglieder dürfen nach Deutschland kommen ?
Nicht alle Familien-Mitglieder von Flüchtlingen dürfen nach Deutschland kommen.
Nur die Kern-Familie von Flüchtlingen darf nach Deutschland kommen.
Zur Kern-Familie gehören: • minderjährige Kinder • Eltern • Ehepartner, wenn die Ehe vor der Flucht geschlossen wurde • Geschwister unter 18 Jahren
Wann dürfen Familien-Mitglieder aus der Kern-Familie nicht nach Deutschland kommen ?
Nicht alle Familien-Mitglieder aus der Kern-Familie dürfen nach Deutschland kommen.
Nicht kommen dürfen: • Flüchtlinge mit Vorstrafen. • Flüchtlinge, die Gefährder sind.
Bei Gefährdern besteht ein Risiko, dass sie eine Straftat in Deutschland begehen.
Sicherheits-Probleme bei Facebook
Facebook sammelt viele Informationen von Nutzern.
Viele Nutzer möchten das nicht länger mitmachen.
Viele Menschen nutzen die Internet-Plattform Facebook.
Sie teilen dort Fotos, Videos und Nachrichten.
Dabei geben sie viele Infos an Facebook weiter.
Deshalb sind bei Facebook viele Infos über die Nutzer gespeichert.
Zum Beispiel:
• wo die Nutzer wohnen
• wo die Nutzer arbeiten
• welche Interessen die Nutzer haben
• welche Freunde die Nutzer haben
Viele Facebook-Nutzer haben dabei ein schlechtes Gefühl.
Denn sie wissen nicht: Was macht Facebook mit den vielen Infos ?
Sind die Infos bei Facebook sicher ?
Bei Facebook gab es jetzt eine große Sicherheits-Lücke.
Was ist passiert ?
Eine Firma hat viele Infos auf Facebook ausspioniert: bei insgesamt über 50 Millionen Nutzern.
Die Firma heißt Cambridge Analytica.
Die Firma hat mit den Facebook-Nutzer-Infos wahrscheinlich viel Geld verdient.
Und sie hat die Nutzer-Infos wahrscheinlich für diesen Zweck benutzt:
Die Firma hat gezielte Wahl-Werbung auf Facebook für Donald Trump und seine Partei gemacht, während des Wahl-Kampfs in den USA.
Folgen für die Nutzer von Facebook
Viele Menschen fragen sich jetzt: Ist das in Ordnung ?
Dürfen Firmen wie Cambridge Analytica mit Nutzer-Infos solche Geschäfte machen ?
Hat die Firma das Wahl-Ergebnis in den USA beeinflusst ?
Und warum schützt Facebook die Nutzer-Infos nicht besser ?
Viele Menschen sind jetzt unzufrieden mit Facebook.
Und einige Firmen wollen mit Facebook jetzt keine Geschäfte mehr machen.
Einige Menschen und Firmen löschen nun sogar ihr Facebook-Profil.
Das Profil ist die persönliche Seite von einer Person oder von einer Firma auf Facebook.
Dort sieht man das Profilbild, Nachrichten und viele andere Infos.
Auch die taz hat sich gefragt: Wie sollen wir mit Facebook umgehen ?
Sollen wir unsere Facebook-Profile löschen ?
Und wenn ja: Worauf müssen wir dabei achten ?
Hier ein paar Ratschläge dazu:
• vor dem Löschen die liebsten Bilder und Termine speichern
• die Freunde vorwarnen, dass man in Zukunft nicht mehr über Facebook erreichbar ist
• Telefonnummern und Email-Adressen mit den Freunden austauschen
• vielleicht weitere Apps löschen, die Facebook gehören und die Nutzer-Infos sammeln, zum Beispiel Instagram oder Whats-App.
taz leicht sagt erstmal "Tschüss ! "
taz leicht gibt es bald nicht mehr regelmäßig.
Ab Oktober gibt es die Texte nur noch zu besonderen Ereignissen.
taz leicht sagt erstmal "Tschüss" !
taz leicht übersetzt bald weniger taz-Texte in Leichte Sprache.
Ab Oktober gibt es die Texte nur noch zu besonderen Ereignissen.
Zum Beispiel zu politischen Wahlen oder Sport-Ereignissen.
Warum gibt es weniger leichte Texte in der taz ?
Die taz hat zu wenig Geld, um das Leichte-Sprache-Projekt weiterzumachen.
Das ist schade.
Aber wir von taz leicht sind auch froh.
Unsere Übersetzungen haben viel Spaß gemacht.
Wir haben über 70 taz-Texte in Leichte Sprache übersetzt.
Durch diese Texte wissen nun mehr Menschen: Leichte Sprache ist wichtig !
Viele Menschen brauchen Leichte Sprache !
Für unsere leichten Texte gab es viel Lob.
Ganz unterschiedliche Leser haben uns geschreiben.
Zum Beispiel diese Leser:
• Leser mit Lernschwierigkeiten
• Verwandte von Lesern mit Lernschwierigkeiten
• Sprachlehrer
• Leser, die in der Flüchtlings-Hilfe arbeiten
• Leser, die gerade Deutsch lernen
• Eltern, die taz leicht ihren Kindern vorlesen
Eine Frau hat uns geschrieben.
Sie schrieb über ihren Mann:
Mein Mann war früher taz-Leser.
Dann hatte er einen Schlag-Anfall.
Das ist eine Gehirn-Erkrankung.
Mein Mann konnte danach nicht mehr gut lesen.
Auch die taz-Texte waren zu schwer zu lesen.
Mit taz leicht wurde das anders.
Mit taz leicht können mein Mann und ich die taz wieder zusammen lesen.
Eine andere Leserin sagte über unsere leichten taz-Texte: "Es ist schön, die gleiche Zeitung zu lesen, die auch alle anderen lesen können."
Das waren tolle Erfahrungen.
Wir wollen deshalb Danke sagen an unsere Unterstützer:
An taz, taz Panter Stiftung und Fürst Donnersmarck Stiftung.
Und an alle Prüfer vom Leichte-Sprache-Büro Capito, die unsere Texte noch besser gemacht haben !
Danke auch an unsere Leser !
Und hoffentlich bis bald.
Wir melden uns auf Twitter und Facebook, wenn es wieder neue taz-leicht-Texte gibt.
Hier geht es zu taz leicht auf Twitter.
Hier geht es zu taz leicht auf Facebook.
Politisch rechte Verlage auf der Buch-Messe
Auch politisch rechte Verlage sind auf der Buch-Messe in Leipzig.
Aber viele Menschen sind dagegen.
Vom 15. bis zum 18. März 2018 findet die Buch-Messe in Leipzig statt.
Was ist eine Buch-Messe ?
Eine Buch-Messe ist eine große Veranstaltung zum Thema Lesen.
Dort werden neue Bücher und Zeitschriften vorgestellt.
Dort gibt es viele Diskussionen und Buch-Lesungen.
Auch politisch rechte Verlage sind auf der Buch-Messe in Leipzig.
Was ist ein Verlag ?
Ein Verlag gibt Bücher und Zeitschriften heraus.
Auch rechte Verlage wollen auf der Buch-Messe ihre neuen Bücher und Zeitschriften vorstellen.
Auch sie wollen Diskussionen und Buch-Lesungen anbieten.
Was planen rechte Verlage für die Buch-Messe in Leipzig ?
Die rechte Zeitschrift " Compact " plant zum Beispiel eine Lesung mit dem Autor Akif Pirinçci.
Pirinçci spricht man so aus:
Pi-rin-tschi.
Wer ist Akif Pirinçci ?
Akif Pirinçci schreibt Bücher und kommt ursprünglich aus der Türkei.
Akif Pirinçci hat gegen Flüchtlinge und Muslime gehetzt.
Dafür wurde er von einem Gericht verurteilt.
Hier ist ein Foto von Akif Pirinçci:
Auch andere Mitarbeiter und Autoren von rechten Verlagen und Zeitschriften hetzen oft gegen Flüchtlinge und Muslime.
Viele Menschen sind dagegen, dass rechte Verlage auf der Buch-Messe hetzen können.
Diese Menschen wollen verbieten, dass rechte Verlage an der Buch-Messe teilnehmen.
Aber die Leitung von der Buch-Messe sagt: Es gibt Meinungs-Freiheit in Deutschland.
Auch rechte Verlage dürfen ihre Meinung sagen.
Das gilt auch auf der Buch-Messe.
Protest von anderen Verlagen
Andere Verlage auf der Buch-Messe sagen nun: Wenn die Leitung von der Buch-Messe in Leipzig nichts macht, dann unternehmen wir selber etwas gegen die rechten Verlage !
Die anderen Verlage haben eine Gruppe gegründet.
Diese Gruppe heißt " Verlage gegen Rechts ".
Die Gruppe bietet auf der Buch-Messe viele Veranstaltungen an.
Zum Beispiel Veranstaltungen zum Thema Rassismus.
Damit zeigt die Gruppe: Wir sind gegen rechte Hetze.
Wir sind gegen rechte Verlage auf der Buch-Messe.
Polizei-Kosten bei Fußball-Spielen
Manche Fußball-Fans sind gewalttätig.
Die Polizei soll das verhindern.
Aber wer soll die Polizei bezahlen ?
Bei Fußball-Spielen kommt es manchmal zu Gewalt.
Zum Beispiel im Fußball-Stadion oder vor dem Stadion.
Warum kommt es zu Gewalt ?
Bei manchen Fans führt die Liebe zur eigenen Mannschaft zu Hass gegen eine andere Mannschaft.
Das gilt vor allem für Fans von Mannschaften in benachbarten Städten.
Ein Beispiel:
Wer Fan vom Hamburger SV ist, ist Gegner vom SV Werder Bremen.
Fußball-Spiele zwischen diesen Mannschaften heißen: Hoch-Risiko-Spiele.
Denn das Gewalt-Risiko ist hier besonders hoch.
Bei einem Hoch-Risiko-Spiel ist viel Polizei im Einsatz.
Die Polizei sorgt bei diesen Spielen für: • Sicherheit im Fußball-Stadion und in der Nähe • Sicherheit vor und nach dem Fußball-Spiel
Aber wenn viel Polizei im Einsatz ist, kostet das auch viel Geld.
Wer bezahlt den Polizei-Einsatz ?
Den Polizei-Einsatz bezahlt das Bundesland, in dem das Fußball-Spiel stattfindet.
Der Polizei-Einsatz wird also mit Steuer-Geld bezahlt.
Jetzt hat ein Gericht in Bremen entschieden: Das Bundesland Bremen muss bei Hoch-Risiko-Spielen nicht allein den Polizei-Einsatz bezahlen.
Aber wer soll den Polizei-Einsatz noch bezahlen ?
Das Gericht in Bremen sagt: Der Veranstalter der Fußball-Spiele soll mitbezahlen.
Der Veranstalter ist die Deutsche Fußball Liga, kurz DFL.
Die DFL ist ein Zusammenschluss aus allen deutschen Vereinen mit Profi-Fußball-Mannschaften.
Das Gericht in Bremen hat entschieden: Die DFL muss bei Hoch-Risiko-Spielen den Polizei-Einsatz mitbezahlen.
Warum kann das Urteil aus Bremen zum Problem werden ?
Das Gerichts-Urteil aus Bremen kann zum Problem werden.
Denn manchmal werden Gerichts-Urteile auf andere Bereiche übertragen.
Das Gerichts-Urteil zu Gewalt bei Fußball-Spielen könnte zum Beispiel auf Demonstrationen übertragen werden.
Auch bei Demonstrationen kommt es zu Gewalt.
Auch hier ist die Polizei im Einsatz.
Auch diese Kosten trägt bisher das zuständige Bundesland.
Wenn das Gerichts-Urteil auch für Demonstrationen gilt, dann heißt das: Auch hier müssen die Veranstalter den Polizei-Einsatz mitbezahlen.
Dann können nur noch reiche Veranstalter eine Demonstration mit Polizei-Einsatz durchführen.
Und das ist nicht gerecht.
Hilfe für Flüchtlinge
Viele Menschen helfen Flüchtlingen.
Die taz stellt einige Helfer aus Sachsen und Brandenburg vor.
Am 1. September 2019 gibt es 2 Landtags-Wahlen.
Eine Landtags-Wahl ist im Bundesland Sachsen.
Und eine Landtags-Wahl ist im Bundesland Brandenburg.
Die Bürger wählen dort Parteien und Politiker.
Die Parteien und Politiker entscheiden dann über die Politik in den 2 Bundesländern.
Die Zeitung taz schreibt über die 2 Landtags-Wahlen.
Deshalb will die taz wissen: Welche Themen sind den Menschen in Sachsen und Brandenburg wichtig ?
Ein wichtiges Thema sind Flüchtlinge.
Vor 4 Jahren kamen viele Flüchtlinge nach Deutschland, auch nach Sachsen und Brandenburg.
Viele Flüchtlinge mussten dort ein neues Leben beginnen.
Sie hatten oft keine Arbeit und keine Wohnung.
Und sie hatten meistens wenig Geld.
Viele Menschen aus Sachsen und Brandenburg wollten den Flüchtlingen deshalb helfen.
Das war nicht immer leicht.
Denn einige Menschen in Sachsen und Brandenburg sind gegen Flüchtlinge in Deutschland.
Die Helfer mussten also gegen viele Vorurteile kämpfen.
Die taz hat mit einigen Helfern gesprochen.
Hier stellen wir 3 von ihnen vor.
Dieter Bollmann
Dieter Bollmann ist 82 Jahre alt.
Er wohnt in Frankfurt ( Oder ) in Brandenburg.
Früher war er Anwalt.
Heute arbeitet er ohne Bezahlung.
Er hilft bei drohenden Abschiebungen.
Also wenn der Staat zu Flüchtlingen sagt: Sie müssen Deutschland jetzt verlassen.
Sie haben hier kein Aufenthalts-Recht.
Sie müssen zurück in ihr Heimat-Land.
Wie kam Dieter Bollmann zu dieser Arbeit ?
Er wurde vor 4 Jahren gefragt: Herr Bollmann, Sie sind doch Anwalt ?
Können Sie 2 Brüdern helfen ?
Sie kommen aus dem afrikanischen Land Kamerun.
Der deutsche Staat sagt: Die 2 Brüder sollen Deutschland verlassen.
Sie sollen zurück nach Kamerun.
Dieter Bollmann hat geholfen.
Und er hatte Erfolg.
Die 2 Brüder leben noch in Deutschland.
Sie haben eine Ausbildung gemacht.
Und ein Bruder hat eine Familie gegründet.
Mittlerweile hat Dieter Bollmann viele Abschiebungen verhindert.
Yvonne Trenner
Yvonne Trenner wohnt in Oranienburg in Brandenburg.
Seit 5 Jahren hilft sie Flüchtlingen.
Zuerst hat sie Flüchtlinge zu Ärzten oder Vermietern begleitet.
Und sie hat Deutsch unterrichtet.
Heute hilft sie Flüchtlingen bei der Arbeits-Suche.
Dafür hat sie sogar ein eigenes Büro eröffnet.
Yvonne Trenner vermittelt 50 bis 60 Flüchtlinge pro Jahr in eine Ausbildungen oder in ein Praktikum.
Und sie hilft beim Bewerben.
Manchmal dauert die Arbeits-Suche lange.
Das sorgt für viel Frust.
Aber oft klappt es und das ist gut.
Für Flüchtlinge ist Arbeit wichtig für einen Neu-Beginn.
Yvonne Trenner sagt dazu: Nur so können Flüchtlinge ein Leben in Deutschland aufbauen.
Sie verdienen bei der Arbeit eigenes Geld.
Und sie lernen die deutsche Sprache schneller.
Außerdem lernen sie bei der Arbeit andere Menschen kennen.
Denn Deutsche und Flüchtlinge arbeiten zusammen.
Das hilft gegen Berührungs-Ängste und Vorurteile.
Franziska Meißner
Franziska Meißner wohnt in Leipzig in Sachsen.
Sie ist Schwimm-Lehrerin und leitet seit 4 Jahren ein Schwimm-Projekt.
Dabei bringt sie auch Flüchtlingen das Schwimmen bei.
Einige Schwimm-Schüler sind 12 Jahre alt.
Und einige sind fast 50 Jahr alt.
Das Schwimmen bringt Menschen zusammen.
Im Schwimm-Unterricht wird auch Deutsch geübt.
Franziska Meißner hofft: Das Schwimm-Projekt hilft den Menschen beim Neu-Beginn in Deutschland.
Am Anfang hat Franziska Meißner gedacht: Vielleicht wird das Schwimm-Projekt schwierig.
Vielleicht wird sie als Frau nicht respektiert.
Denn in einigen Kulturen ist es nicht üblich, dass Frauen auch Männer unterrichten.
Deshalb hat Franziska Meißner zuerst gemeinsam mit einem männlichen Schwimm-Lehrer unterrichtet.
Doch ihre Sorgen waren unnötig.
Alles hat gut geklappt.
Heute unterrichtet Franziska Meißner alleine.
Ihre Kurse sind beliebt.
Es werden immer mehr Kurse.
Und sie sind alle ausgebucht.
Mehr Inklusion für den RBB
Der RBB-Rundfunk-Rat soll alle Menschen in Berlin und Brandenburg vertreten.
Aber kein Mitglied im RBB-Rundfunk-Rat hat selbst eine Behinderung.
Christian Specht ist im Vorstand von der Lebenshilfe in Berlin.
Die Lebenshilfe unterstützt Menschen mit Behinderungen.
Christian Specht hat selbst eine Behinderung.
Und er findet: Im Programm vom Sender RBB kommen zu wenige Menschen mit Behinderungen vor.
Und der RBB tut noch zu wenig für Barriere-Freiheit.
Christian Specht fordert: Das muss sich ändern.
Menschen mit Behinderungen müssen im Programm vorkommen.
Menschen mit Behinderungen sollen beim RBB mitreden.
Was ist der RBB ?
RBB ist die Abkürzung für: Rundfunk Berlin Brandenburg.
Der RBB sendet Programme im Fernsehen und im Radio.
Der RBB gehört zu einem Verbund von mehreren regionalen Sendern in Deutschland.
Dieser Verbund heißt: ARD.
Zur ARD gehören zum Beispiel: • der Nord-Deutsche Rundfunk im Norden von Deutschland, • der Bayerische Rundfunk in Bayern, • und auch der RBB in Berlin und Brandenburg gehört dazu.
Alle diese Sender sind öffentlich-rechtlich.
Das bedeutet: Alle Bürger in Deutschland zahlen Geld für diese Sender.
Dafür müssen diese Sender einen Auftrag erfüllen.
Der Auftrag steht in einem Vertrag, dem Rundfunk-Staats-Vertrag.
In dem Vertrag steht zum Beispiel: Das Programm vom RBB muss verschiedene Meinungen aus der Gesellschaft abbilden.
Das Programm muss die Wünsche von Menschen mit Behinderungen berücksichtigen.
Wer überwacht die Einhaltung des Auftrags ?
Der RBB-Rundfunk-Rat überwacht die Einhaltung des Auftrags.
Er überwacht das bereits gesendete Programm.
Der RBB-Rundfunk-Rat hat 30 Mitglieder.
Die Mitglieder vertreten verschiedene gesellschaftliche Gruppen.
Sie kommen zum Beispiel: • aus der Politik • aus der katholischen und evangelischen Kirche • aus jüdischen Gemeinden • aus dem deutschen Gewerkschafts-Bund, der sich für die Rechte von Arbeitnehmern einsetzt • aus dem Sport-Verbund • aus dem Frauen-Rat
Aber viele gesellschaftliche Gruppen sind nicht dabei.
Zum Beispiel Muslime, Schwule und Lesben.
Außerdem ist kein Mensch mit Behinderung im RBB-Rundfunk-Rat.
Wie machen es andere Sender ?
Bei anderen öffentlich-rechtlichen Sendern ist es anders.
Zum Beispiel beim Sender BR.
BR ist kurz für: Bayerischer Rundfunk.
Auch der BR hat einen Rundfunk-Rat mit 50 Mitgliedern.
Und die Mitglieder kommen auch aus ganz verschiedenen Gruppen.
Hier gibt es aber einen Vertreter für Menschen mit Behinderungen.
Wenn der BR für mehr Vielfalt sorgen kann, dann kann der RBB das auch.
Der BR kann ein Vorbild für den RBB sein.
Der RBB kann auch Menschen mit Behinderungen beteiligen.
Dafür gibt es bald eine gute Chance.
Im Februar 2019 wird der RBB-Rundfunk-Rat neu gebildet.
Christian Specht fordert deshalb: Der Rundfunk-Rat muss endlich ein Zeichen für Inklusion setzen.
Menschen mit Behinderung müssen ab Februar Mitglied werden im neuen Rundfunk-Rat.
Sonst werden die Meinungen von Menschen mit Behinderungen nicht ausreichend vertreten.
Christian Specht ist mit seiner Forderung schon weit gekommen.
Er und seine Unterstützer haben viel erreicht.
Im Vertrag von der Berliner Regierung steht bereits: Die Berliner Regierung will die Zusammensetzung vom RBB-Rundfunk-Rat verbessern.
Sie will mehr Vielfalt im RBB-Rundfunk-Rat.
Wer unterstützt Christian Specht ?
Die Berliner Lebenshilfe und der Berliner Behinderten-Verband unterstützen Christian Specht.
Sie geben Christian Specht recht und sagen: Menschen mit Behinderung fühlen sich nicht durch den RBB-Rundfunk-Rat vertreten.
Das muss sich ändern.
Zum Beispiel haben sie diese Idee:
Die Mitglieder im RBB-Rundfunk-Rat wechseln sich ab.
Erst arbeitet ein Kirchen-Vertreter mit.
Danach arbeitet ein Behinderten-Vertreter mit.
Wer sieht Christian Spechts Forderung kritisch ?
Einige Politiker sehen die Forderung kritisch.
Die SPD-Politikerin Karin Halsch sagt: Die Interessen von Menschen mit Behinderungen werden im RBB-Rundfunk-Rat bereits berücksichtigt.
Denn andere Vertreter denken die Interessen von Menschen mit Behinderungen mit.
Der CDU-Politiker Christian Goiny sagt: Zum Beispiel denken Vertreter aus der Politik die Interessen von Menschen mit Behinderungen mit.
Der Grünen-Politiker Andreas Otto sagt: Die Forderung nach einem Behinderten-Vertreter führt zu weiteren Forderungen.
Das kann zum Problem werden:
Dann wollen weitere Gruppen im Rundfunk-Rat sitzen.
Dann hat der Rundfunk-Rat zu viele Mitglieder.
Dann kann der Rundfunk-Rat vielleicht nicht mehr richtig arbeiten.
Sicher ist: Christian Specht wird nicht aufgeben.
Er ist hartnäckig.
Er fragt und fordert weiter, bis Menschen mit Behinderungen im RBB-Rundfunk-Rat vertreten sind.
Spieler ?
Tore ?
Die WM im Überblick
Wie laufen die Spiel-Runden ab ?
Was ist neu bei dieser WM ?
Welche Mannschaft hat Chancen auf den Pokal ?
Die WM 2018 beginnt.
32 Mannschaften sind in Russland dabei.
64 Fußball-Spiele wird es geben.
Und die wichtigen Fragen lauten erstmal: Wie laufen die Spiel-Runden ab ?
Was ist neu bei dieser WM ?
Welche Mannschaften haben Chancen auf den Pokal ?
Welche Mannschaft überrascht vielleicht ?
Welcher Spieler überrascht vielleicht ?
Wie laufen die Spiel-Runden ab ?
Bei der WM gibt es mehrere Spiel-Runden.
• Die Vorrunde
• Und die K.O.-Runden
In der Vorrunde gibt es 48 Spiele.
Die Mannschaften werden in 8 Gruppen aufgeteilt.
In jeder Gruppe sind 4 Mannschaften.
Die deutsche Mannschaft ist zum Beispiel in einer Gruppe mit: Mexiko, Schweden und Südkorea.
Alle Mannschaften in den Gruppen spielen gegeneinander.
Die besten 2 Mannschaften aus jeder Gruppe kommen dann weiter.
Sie kommen weiter in die K.O.-Runden.
In den K.O.-Runden gibt es 16 Spiele.
Wofür steht K.O. ?
K.O. ist eine Abkürzung für: knock-out.
Das ist Englisch und heißt: außer Gefecht.
Denn nach jedem K.O.-Spiel kommt nur eine Mannschaft weiter.
Nur die Gewinner-Mannschaft kommt weiter in die nächste Runde.
Die Verlierer-Mannschaft scheidet aus.
Das geht auf diese Weise immer so weiter bis zum WM-Finale.
Bis dann am Ende der WM-Gewinner feststeht.
Das Problem ist: Nicht immer steht am Spiel-Ende ein eindeutiger Gewinner fest.
Manchmal haben die Mannschaften gleich viele Tore.
Was passiert dann ?
Dann gibt es eine Verlängerung.
Und dann vielleicht noch ein Elf-Meter-Schießen.
Bis es am Ende ein eindeutiges Ergebnis gibt.
Was ist neu an dieser WM ?
Bei dieser WM gibt es zum ersten Mal den Video-Beweis.
Was ist der Video-Beweis ?
Oft kommt es bei Fußball-Spielen zu schwierigen Situationen.
Dann ist nicht ganz sicher: War der Spieler im Abseits ?
Hat der Spieler die Hand benutzt ?
Dann entscheidet der Schiedsrichter, was passiert ist und welche Folgen das hat.
Doch nicht immer hat der Schiedsrichter alles im Blick.
Der Video-Beweis soll Fehl-Entscheidungen verhindern.
Dafür hat der Schiedsrichter mehrere Helfer.
Die Helfer schauen sich die schwierige Situation im Video noch mal an.
Und sie sagen dem Schiedsrichter dann, wie er entscheiden soll.
Am Video-Beweis gibt es viel Kritik
Zum Beispiel diese 2 Kritik-Punkte.
Erste Kritik:
Das Spiel wird oft für den Video-Beweis unterbrochen.
Einige Minuten geht das Spiel dann nicht weiter.
In dieser Zeit wird das Video ausgewertet und eine Entscheidung getroffen.
Das stört den Spiel-Fluss.
Bei der WM sind deshalb mehr Helfer als sonst für den Video-Beweis zuständig.
So soll die Entscheidung schneller gefällt werden.
Zweite Kritik:
Die Zuschauer im Stadion bekommen oft zu wenige Infos.
Sie wissen oft nicht: Was zeigt der Video-Beweis ?
Welche neuen Infos hat der Schiedsrichter ?
Was sagen ihm seine Helfer ?
Bei der WM werden deshalb Infos auf Stadion-Bildschirmen eingeblendet.
Die Zuschauer sehen auf den Bildschirmen: 1. Eine Video-Wiederholung von entscheidenden Szenen.
2. Welche Infos der Schiedsrichter gerade bekommt.
Welche Mannschaft hat Chancen auf den Pokal ?
Frankreich könnte diesmal den Pokal gewinnen.
Das Land hat eine starke Mannschaft.
Mit vielen jungen, begabten Angreifern.
Auch Spanien und Brasilien haben gute Chancen.
Und auch Deutschland könnte wieder Weltmeister werden.
Obwohl die letzten deutschen Spiele vor der WM nicht gut waren.
Aber die deutsche Mannschaft ist dafür bekannt, dass sie erst im Wettbewerb richtig loslegt.
Welche Mannschaft überrascht vielleicht ?
Viele Fans glauben: Belgien könnte bei der WM überraschen.
Das Land könnte vielleicht gewinnen.
Denn die Mannschaft hat starke Einzelspieler.
Viele Fans haben schon bei früheren Turnieren an Belgien geglaubt.
Bisher hat es die belgische Mannschaft aber nie weit geschafft.
Welcher Spieler überrascht vielleicht ?
Mohamed Salah ist Stürmer in der ägyptischen Mannschaft.
Er hat zuletzt in der englischen Liga sehr stark gespielt.
Er spielt dort beim Verein FC Liverpool.
Mohamed Salah wurde mehrfach geehrt:
Er ist Spieler der Saison in England und Fußballer des Jahres.
Das hatte ihm niemand zugetraut.
Seine ägyptische Mannschaft ist nicht so stark.
Aber Salah will jetzt auch mit Ägypten bei der WM überraschen.
Hier ist ein Foto von ihm:
Warum rennt Neuer aus dem Tor ?
Christian Specht ärgert sich über das WM-Spiel der deutschen Mannschaft.
Vor allem über Torwart Manuel Neuer.
Das Bild zeigt Manuel Neuer.
Den Torwart der deutschen Mannschaft.
Sein Verhalten ärgert mich.
Er ist beim Spiel gegen Südkorea einfach aus dem Tor gerannt.
Die südkoreanische Mannschaft hat dann ein Tor gemacht.
Das Spiel war sowieso ein Reinfall.
Aber Neuer hat es total versaut.
Das geht nicht.
Ein Torwart darf nicht einfach aus dem Tor abhauen.
Was, wenn das alle machen ?
Wenn alle einfach so mit ihrem Job aufhören ?
Wenn die hier in der taz einfach aufhören, eine Zeitung zu machen ?
Ich kann es immer noch nicht glauben: Neuer hat einfach das Tor verlassen !
Wahl zur Behinderten-Vertretung
Viele Firmen haben eine Schwer-Behinderten-Vertretung.
Diese Vertretung wird aktuell neu gewählt, zum Beispiel in der Stadt Bremen.
Viele Firmen haben eine Schwer-Behinderten-Vertretung.
Diese Vertretung besteht aus einer oder mehreren Personen.
Was machen diese Personen in der Firma ?
Sie unterstützen schwer-behinderte Mitarbeiter.
Sie vertreten die Interessen von schwer-behinderten Mitarbeitern.
Die Schwer-Behinderten-Vertreter werden alle 4 Jahre neu gewählt.
Aktuell finden die Neu-Wahlen statt.
Haben alle Firmen eine Schwer-Behinderten-Vertretung ?
Die Schwer-Behinderten-Vertretung haben nur Firmen mit 5 oder mehr schwer-behinderten Mitarbeitern.
Was bedeutet "Schwer-Behinderung" ?
Das Wort kommt aus dem Sozial-Gesetz-Buch.
Danach sind Behinderungen verschieden schwer.
Eine leichte Behinderung ist zum Beispiel, wenn man eine Gehhilfe braucht.
Eine sehr schwere Behinderung ist zum Beispiel, wenn man dauerhaft im Rollstuhl sitzt.
Das Versorgungs-Amt kümmert sich um die Angelegenheiten von Menschen mit einer Schwer-Behinderung.
Das Amt bestimmt auch den Schwere-Grad einer Behinderung.
Wie bestimmt das Amt den Schwere-Grad ?
Es benutzt dazu die Zahlen-Werte 20 bis 100.
Der Zahlen-Wert 20 bedeutet: Die Person hat eine leichte Behinderung.
Der Zahlen-Wert 100 bedeutet: Die Person hat eine sehr schwere Behinderung.
Ab einem Zahlen-Wert von 50 gilt ein Mensch als schwer-behindert.
Außerdem gilt: Ab einem Zahlen-Wert von 30 gibt es eine Gleichstellung zur Schwer-Behinderung.
Das bedeutet: Gleichgestellte Menschen haben ähnliche Rechte wie schwer-behinderte Menschen.
Welche Rechte gibt es ?
Im Sozial-Gesetz-Buch steht: Schwer-behinderte und gleichgestellte Menschen können am Arbeitsplatz ähnliche Dinge fordern.
Dazu gehören zum Beispiel diese Dinge:
• ein Arbeitsplatz ohne Hindernisse
• ein besonderer Kündigungs-Schutz
• zusätzlicher Urlaub
• Reha-Maßnahmen
Hier beginnt die Arbeit der Schwer-Behinderten-Vertreter.
Sie unterstützen diese beiden Mitarbeiter-Gruppen bei der Durchsetzung ihrer Rechte am Arbeitsplatz.
Außerdem haben Schwer-Behinderten-Vertreter diese Aufgaben:
• Sie setzen sich für mehr Teilhabe in der Firma ein.
• Sie planen Weiterbildungen.
• Sie sind bei Bewerbungs-Gesprächen dabei.
• Sie beraten bei Verträgen.
• Sie sind Ansprech-Partner und Vertrauens-Person.
Alle Mitarbeiter in einer Firma können Schwer-Behinderten-Vertreter werden.
Und wie gesagt:
Aktuell werden neue Vertreter gewählt.
Noch bis zum 30. November 2018 finden die Wahlen statt.
Die taz hat sich die Wahl in Bremen genauer angeschaut.
Viele Firmen machen bei dieser Wahl mit.
Insgesamt können 1700 schwer-behinderte und gleichgestellte Personen in Bremen ihre Schwer-Behinderten-Vertretung wählen.
Eine dieser Firmen ist der Sender "Radio Bremen".
Hier ist Dagmar Schwärmer die Schwer-Behinderten-Vertreterin.
Sie hat gerade viel zu tun.
Denn sie muss die Wahl planen.
Gleichzeitig muss sie ihre Aufgaben als Vertreterin erfüllen.
Sie sagt über ihre Aufgaben bei "Radio Bremen": Ich mache auf das Thema Inklusion aufmerksam.
Ich frage mich: Wie können wir die Bedingungen verbessern für Menschen mit Behinderungen in unserer Firma ?
Manchmal muss ich dafür immer wieder dieselben Dinge sagen.
Nur so wird Inklusion auch Teil des Alltags in der Firma.
Zum Beispiel muss ich immer wieder sagen: Bewerber sollen nur nach ihren Fähigkeiten beurteilt werden !
Was für Fähigkeiten und Ziele braucht ein Schwer-Behinderten-Vertreter ?
Dagmar Schwärmer sagt: Schwer-Behinderten-Vertreter arbeiten ehrenamtlich, also freiwillig und manchmal ohne Bezahlung.
Trotzdem haben sie viele Aufgaben zu erledigen.
Sie müssen also viel Einsatz zeigen.
Dagmar Schwärmer sagt: Mein Ziel ist zum Beispiel ein Wandel in der Gesellschaft.
Ich will mehr Zusammenhalt und Inklusion.
Damit fange ich bei "Radio Bremen" an.
Aktion gegen Plastik-Müll
Viele Lebens-Mittel im Supermarkt sind in Plastik verpackt.
Das ist oft unnötig.
In Berlin gab es dagegen eine Aktion.
In einem Supermarkt in Berlin hat eine Aktion stattgefunden:
Eine Gruppe von Menschen hat dort eingekauft.
Sie hat Produkte in ihren Einkaufs-Wagen gepackt und bezahlt.
Sie hat dann alle Produkte aus dem Einkaufs-Wagen geräumt und im Supermarkt auf den Boden gelegt.
Warum hat die Gruppe das gemacht ?
Um den Plastik-Müll von den Produkten zu entfernen.
Die Menschen haben zum Beispiel: • die Plastik-Folie von einer Gurke abgezogen • Gummi-Bärchen aus der Tüte geholt • Milch aus dem Tetra-Pack gegossen
Sie haben die Produkte dann umgefüllt.
Zum Beispiel in Stoffbeutel, Tupper-Dosen oder Glas-Flaschen.
Die Menschen haben die Plastik-Verpackungen in ihrem Einkaufs-Wagen liegen gelassen.
Denn ein Super-Markt muss einen Teil von den Plastik-Verpackungen wieder zurücknehmen.
Warum haben die Menschen die Aktion gemacht ?
Die Aktion heißt " Plastik-Attacke ".
Die Aktion hat es in anderen Städten in anderen Ländern schon öfter gegeben.
Zum Beispiel in den Städten Brüssel, Amsterdam und Oslo.
Mit der Aktion in Berlin hat es " Plastik-Attacke " das 1. Mal in Deutschland gegeben.
Mitglieder von dem Verband BUND-Jugend haben die Aktion in Berlin organisiert.
BUND ist die Abkürzung für Bund für Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland.
Der Verband BUND-Jugend setzt sich für Umwelt-Schutz ein.
Die Aktion " Plastik-Attacke " soll zeigen: Es gibt zu viele Plastik-Verpackungen.
Dadurch gibt es zu viel Plastik-Müll.
Die Aktion " Plastik-Attacke " soll Supermärkte dazu bringen, weniger Plastik-Verpackungen anzubieten.
Warum ist Plastik-Müll schlecht ?
Plastik-Müll verschmutzt die Umwelt.
In Deutschland gibt es jedes Jahr 5 Millionen Tonnen Plastik-Müll.
Die BUND-Jugend sagt: Weniger als die Hälfte von dem Plastik-Müll wird weiter verarbeitet und wieder verwendet.
Der Großteil von dem Plastik-Müll wird verbrannt.
Das ist schlecht für das Klima.
Ein weiterer Teil von dem Plastik-Müll landet über Umwege im Meer.
Wale, Delfine, Schildkröten und Fische verwechseln den Plastik-Müll dann oft mit Nahrung.
Sie fressen den Plastik-Müll und sterben oft daran.
Wie reagieren Menschen auf die Aktionen BUND-Jugend ?
Im Berliner Supermarkt war es zum Beispiel so:
Manche Menschen haben nicht den Sinn von einer Aktion wie " Plastik-Attacke " verstanden.
Aber manche Menschen fanden die Aktionen gut.
Manche Menschen haben bei " Plastik-Attacke " im Berliner Supermarkt sogar spontan mitgemacht.
Inklusion im Fußball
Christian Specht malt Bilder zur WM.
Diesmal geht es um das Thema Inklusion.
Bei dem Bild geht es um Menschen mit Behinderungen im Fußball.
Ich finde: Menschen mit Behinderungen sollen nicht ausgeschlossen werden.
Sie sollen bei der WM mitmachen.
Menschen mit und ohne Behinderung sollen in einer Mannschaft spielen.
Dann gibt es weniger Berührungs-Ängste im Sport und bei Fans.
Was mir nicht so gut gefällt:
Eine getrennt Veranstaltung wie die Paralympics.
Die Olympischen Spiele für Menschen mit Behinderungen.
Auch da wurde schon besprochen: Sollen Olympische Spiele und Paralympics zusammen stattfinden ?
Das fände ich gut.
Dann schauen es vielleicht mehr Menschen.
AfD zu Menschen mit Behinderungen
Die Partei AfD hat im Bundestag eine Anfrage gestellt.
Darin geht es um Menschen mit Behinderungen.
Viele Menschen finden die Anfrage schlecht.
Die Partei AfD hat eine Anfrage an die Bundes-Regierung gestellt.
Was ist eine Anfrage ?
In einer Anfrage erfragen Parteien im Bundestag bestimmte Zahlen und Daten.
Zum Beispiel Bevölkerungs-Zahlen.
Die Bundes-Regierung muss die Anfrage dann beantworten.
Sie muss der Partei die Zahlen mitteilen.
Was hat die AfD in ihrer Anfrage gefragt ?
Die AfD hat zum Beispiel gefragt: • Wie viele Menschen mit Behinderungen gibt es in Deutschland ? • Aus welchen Gründen haben diese Menschen eine Behinderung ? • Haben sie eine Behinderung, weil ihre Eltern miteinander verwandt sind ? • Sind die Eltern miteinander verwandt, weil sie einen Migrations-Hintergrund haben ?
Migrations-Hintergrund bedeutet: Ein Mensch kommt aus einem anderen Land.
Oder die Eltern oder Großeltern eines Menschen kommen aus einem anderen Land.
Warum ist die Anfrage von der AfD schlecht ?
Die Fragen von der AfD kann man so verstehen:
• Kann man eine Behinderung vermeiden ?
• Sind die Eltern von Menschen mit Behinderungen daran schuld ?
• Sind Menschen mit Migrations-Hintergrund daran schuld ?
Das würde zeigen: Die AfD sieht eine Behinderung als Problem.
Viele Menschen ärgern sich über die Anfrage von der AfD !
Vor allem Menschen und Verbände ärgern sich, die mit Menschen mit Behinderung arbeiten.
Und für ihre Rechte kämpfen.
Die taz hat mit Ulrich Schneider gesprochen.
Ulrich Schneider arbeitet für den Paritätischen Wohlfahrts-Verband.
Der Paritätische Wohlfahrts-Verband ist für soziale Aufgaben zuständig.
Zum Beispiel für die Arbeit mit Menschen mit Behinderungen.
Ulrich Schneider sagt: Die Anfrage von der AfD ist ein großes Problem.
Denn die AfD stellt mit ihrer Anfrage 2 Zusammenhänge her:
• zwischen Behinderung und verwandten Eltern
• zwischen Behinderung und Migration
Ulrich Schneider sagt: So ein Denken ist menschen-feindlich.
So ein Denken erinnert an den National-Sozialismus.
So ein Denken macht vielen Menschen Angst.
Wir müssen darüber reden.
Wir müssen aufklären.
Wir müssen uns gegen die AfD wehren.
Denn Menschen mit Behinderungen sind ein Teil der Gesellschaft.
Hühner müssen oft leiden
Hühner sind wichtig für die Lebensmittel-Industrie.
Aber sie werden oft sehr schlecht behandelt.
In vielen Lebensmitteln sind Eier.
Zum Beispiel in Nudeln.
Wo kommen diese Eier her ?
Sie kommen meistens von Hühnern auf sehr großen Bauernhöfen.
Oft leben dort viele Hühner zusammen in einem Stall.
Oft leben die Hühner dort in Gruppen in sehr kleinen Käfigen.
Das nennt man: Käfig-Haltung.
In Deutschland gibt es sehr wenig Käfig-Haltung.
Wie kommen die Eier aus Käfig-Haltung trotzdem in die Lebensmittel in deutschen Supermärkten ?
Ein Grund ist: In anderen Ländern gibt es viel mehr Käfig-Haltung.
Und Eier von Hühnern aus Käfig-Haltung sind billig.
Einige deutsche Hersteller kaufen deshalb Eier aus Käfig-Haltung.
Zum Beispiel Hersteller von Nudel-Produkten.
Eier in Produkten von " Birkel " und " 3 Glocken "
" Birkel " und " 3 Glocken " sind zwei deutsche Nudel-Hersteller.
Die beiden Nudel-Hersteller sagen: Wir verwenden Eier von frei laufenden Hühnern.
Den Hühnern geht es gut.
Viele Käufer von Lebensmitteln finden es wichtig, dass es den Hühnern gut geht.
Viele Käufer wollen, • dass die Hühner genug Platz haben, • dass die Hühner das richtige Futter bekommen.
Das nennt man auch: art-gerechte Haltung.
In Europa gibt es Regeln für eine art-gerechte Haltung.
Entdeckung vom Tierschutz-Verein " Peta "
Der Tierschutz-Verein " Peta " hat jetzt herausgefunden: Es ist falsch, was die Nudel-Hersteller sagen.
Es ist falsch, was " Birkel " und " 3 Glocken " sagen.
Der Tierschutz-Verein " Peta " sagt: " Birkel " und " 3 Glocken " benutzen nicht nur Eier von frei laufenden Hühnern.
Sie benutzen für ihre Produkte auch Eier aus Käfig-Haltung.
Sie benutzen Eier von Bauern in den Niederlanden und in Polen.
" Peta " hat sich diese Bauernhöfe angesehen.
" Peta " sagt: Den Hühnern geht es dort nicht gut.
Einige Hühner liegen tot herum.
Einige Hühner haben offene Wunden.
Einige Hühner haben zu wenig zu trinken.
Die Hühner können nicht auf dem Boden scharren und picken.
Die Hühner haben zu wenig Platz in den Käfigen.
Das ist keine art-gerechte Haltung.
Der Tierschutz-Verein " Peta " will dagegen kämpfen.
" Peta " will die Misshandlung von Hühnern stoppen.
" Peta " hat deshalb Bilder von den betroffenen Bauernhöfen veröffentlicht.
Und " Peta " hat eine Aktion gestartet.
Die Aktion heißt: " Mach dich eifrei ".
Bei der Aktion zeigt " Peta ": • dass wir keine Eier zum Leben brauchen • und wodurch wir Eier in Lebensmitteln ersetzen können.
" Peta " sagt: Wenn die Menschen keine Eier mehr essen, dann werden dafür keine Hühner mehr gequält.
Roboter in der Pflege
Forscher entwickeln Roboter für die Pflege von älteren Menschen.
Ist das eine gute Idee ?
In Deutschland gibt es immer mehr alte Menschen.
Warum ist das so ?
Die medizinische Versorgung wird immer besser.
Deshalb werden Menschen immer älter.
Immer mehr Menschen müssen im Alter gepflegt werden.
Gleichzeitig gibt es zu wenige Pflege-Kräfte in der Alten-Pflege.
Woran liegt das ?
Die Arbeit wird schlecht bezahlt.
Die Arbeit ist oft sehr stressig.
Die Arbeit von Pflege-Kräften bekommt wenig Anerkennung.
Es gibt also immer mehr alte Menschen und wenig Pflege-Kräfte.
Deshalb stellt sich diese Frage:
Wer soll die Pflege übernehmen ?
Ein Vorschlag von Forschern, Unternehmern und Politikern lautet: In der Alten-Pflege sollen Pflege-Roboter eingesetzt werden.
Forscher in vielen Ländern forschen an verschiedenen Pflege-Robotern.
Einige Pflege-Roboter können zum Beispiel: • schwer heben • Menschen waschen • Essen reichen • Dinge bringen • telefonieren
So sieht zum Beispiel ein Pflege-Roboter aus:
Sind Pflege-Roboter eine gute Lösung ?
Sollen sie in Zukunft ältere Menschen pflegen ?
Und was halten ältere Menschen davon ?
Wollen sie von Robotern gepflegt werden ?
Und was halten Pflege-Kräfte davon ?
Wollen sie mit Robotern zusammen-arbeiten ?
Die taz spricht darüber mit dem Pflege-Forscher Heiner Friesacher.
Heiner Friesacher sagt dazu: Roboter können nicht alle Aufgaben in der Pflege übernehmen.
Roboter sollen keine älteren Menschen waschen.
Und sie sollen älteren Menschen kein Essen anreichen.
Denn das sind keine einfachen Aufgaben.
Man braucht dafür viel Einfühlungs-Vermögen.
Pflege-Kräfte haben dieses Einfühlungs-Vermögen.
Sie kennen zum Beispiel das Tempo von den älteren Menschen.
Und sie können die körperliche Verfassung und die Gefühle von den älteren Menschen beachten.
Ein Roboter kann das nicht.
Sind Roboter in der Pflege also undenkbar ?
Soll es sie gar nicht geben ?
Heiner Friesacher sagt dazu: Roboter können keine Pflege-Kräfte ersetzen.
Roboter können aber Pflege-Kräfte unterstützen.
Sie können bei der Pflege die Aufgaben übernehmen, die nicht direkt mit Menschen zu tun haben.
Sie können zum Beispiel: • den Fernseher einschalten, • die Spülmaschine einräumen, • als Telefon dienen.
Wenn der Roboter diese Aufgaben übernimmt, haben Pflege-Kräfte mehr Zeit für die älteren Menschen.
Worauf muss man beim Einsatz von Robotern außerdem achten ?
Heiner Friesacher sagt dazu: Zum Beispiel ist die Sicherheit von persönlichen Informationen wichtig.
Die Roboter können filmen und Gespräche aufzeichnen.
Das sind persönliche Informationen über die Menschen.
Aber wer bekommt die Informationen ?
Und wie werden diese Informationen genutzt ?
Über diese und andere Themen müssen Forscher, Firmen und Politiker reden.
Sie müssen alle Beteiligen einbeziehen.
Sie müssen mit Pflege-Kräften, älteren Menschen und ihren Verwandten reden.
Denn Betroffene wissen am besten, wie Pflege funktioniert.
Sie können sagen, was ein Roboter können muss und wo der Roboter-Einsatz hilfreich ist.
Inklusive Musik in Berlin
Musik spielt eine große Rolle in Berlin.
Menschen mit Behinderungen wollen daran teilhaben.
Elektronische Musik gehört zu Berlin.
Bei vielen Partys in Berlin läuft elektronische Musik.
Viele Menschen tanzen gern zu elektronischer Musik.
Und viele Menschen machen selbst elektronische Musik.
Sie machen diese Musik in ihrer Freizeit oder als Beruf.
Menschen mit Behinderungen wollen teilhaben
Menschen mit Behinderungen machen auch Musik.
Aber für Menschen mit Behinderungen gibt es nur wenige Verbindungen mit elektronischer Musik.
Das bedeutet: Es gibt wenig Möglichkeiten zum Musik machen.
Und bei den Partys mit elektronischer Musik können Menschen mit Behinderungen oft nicht mitfeiern.
Die Partys fangen oft zu spät an.
Dann gibt es keine Fahr-Dienste mehr und die Menschen können nicht zur Party kommen.
Sie können auch nicht nach Hause kommen.
Das ist sehr schade.
Einige Menschen in Berlin wollen das ändern.
Sie wollen Menschen mit Behinderungen und elektronische Musik zusammenbringen.
Welche Verbindungen gibt es bereits ?
Der Verein Lebenshilfe will eine eigene Platten-Firma für Menschen mit Behinderungen gründen.
Das ist ein großes Ziel.
Aber zuerst fängt der Verein klein an.
Er organisiert verschiedene Musik-Angebote für Menschen mit Behinderungen.
Dazu gehören zum Beispiel: • eine Arbeits-Gruppe zum Musik machen • eine inklusive Party
Was ist die Arbeits-Gruppe zum Musik machen ?
Der Verein Lebenshilfe organisiert eine Arbeits-Gruppe zum Musik machen.
Die Arbeits-Gruppe heißt: Ick mach Welle.
In der Arbeits-Gruppe können Menschen mit Behinderungen verschiedene Instrumente ausprobieren.
Dazu gehören zum Beispiel auch Geräte von einem DJ.
Was ist ein DJ ?
DJ spricht man so aus:
Di-Dschey.
DJ ist die Abkürzung für das englische Wort Discjockey.
Disjockey spricht man so aus:
Disk-Dschocki.
DJs arbeiten oft auf Partys.
Sie machen Musik zum Tanzen.
In Berlin machen DJs oft elektronische Musik.
Die Arbeits-Gruppe wird begleitet von Musikern.
Sie erklären die Instrumente und Geräte.
Dazu gehören zum Beispiel Computer-Programme, Schlag-Zeug und Platten-Teller für Schall-Platten.
Die Arbeits-Gruppe probiert alles aus.
Und dann macht sie selbst Musik.
Bisher bekommt die Arbeits-Gruppe Geld von der Stadt Berlin.
Und sie bekommt Unterstützung von Instrumente-Herstellern.
Aber es fehlt noch Geld.
Zum Beispiel für einen Probe-Raum.
Was ist die inklusive Party ?
In Berlin-Lichtenberg gibt es diesen Club:
Mensch Meier.
Dort findet ab und zu eine inklusive Party statt.
Die Party heißt: Spaceship.
Spaceship spricht man so aus:
Speys-Schipp.
Das ist Englisch und heißt übersetzt: Raum-Schiff.
Die Party ist für Menschen mit und ohne Behinderungen.
Alle können hier zu elektronischer Musik tanzen.
Es läuft aber auch Hip-Hop und Funk.
Funk spricht man so aus:
Fank.
Die Party macht viel Spaß.
Es sollte noch viel mehr Partys für Menschen mit ohne Behinderungen geben.
Denn eine gemeinsame Party ist sehr schön.
Frankreich gewinnt gegen Belgien
Die französische Mannschaft kann sich freuen.
Sie zieht in das WM-Finale ein.
Frankreich zieht in das WM-Finale ein.
Belgien scheidet aus der WM aus.
Hier alle wichtigen Infos zum Spiel.
► Wie ging das Spiel aus ?
Belgien schießt kein Tor.
Frankreich schießt ein Tor.
Frankreich gewinnt.
► Wie lief das Spiel ab ?
Das Spiel beginnt:
Und Frankreich schießt die Bälle erstmal nicht ordentlich.
Es gibt mehrere Fehl-Pässe.
Das bedeutet: Die französischen Spieler schießen den Ball ihren Mitspielern nicht genau genug zu.
So vergeben die Franzosen einige Tor-Chancen an den Gegner.
Belgien ist erst einmal die stärkere Mannschaft.
Die belgischen Spieler tanzen mit und lauern auf den Ball.
Aber Frankreich kann immer auf einen Spieler setzen.
Das ist Kylian Mbappé.
Er ist erst 19 Jahre alt.
Er ist wahnsinnig schnell.
Er schießt den Ball im Spiel immer in die richtige Richtung.
Hier ist ein Bild von Kylian Mbappé:
Die französische Mannschaft steigt so immer mehr ins Spiel ein.
Sie zeigt immer mehr Einsatz.
Und dann: Frankreich bekommt einen Eckball.
Und die Mannschaft nutzt die Chance !
Der Ball landet im Tor !
Der französische Tor-Schütze heißt Samuel Umtiti.
Hier ist ein Bild von diesem Moment:
In den letzten 30 Minuten zeigt Frankreich noch mehr Leidenschaft.
Das kennt man gar nicht von französischen Mannschaften.
Frankreich ist stark in der Abwehr.
Die Mannschaft spielt klug und konzentriert.
Frankreich gewinnt verdient und zieht ins WM-Finale ein.
Es ist das dritte Mal, dass eine französische Mannschaft das schafft.
Ob Frankreich sein spielerisches Können dort halten kann ?
Wir werden sehen.
Schade ist trotzdem, dass die Belgier draußen sind.
Die belgische Mannschaft galt als Geheim-Favorit.
Und viele Fans haben die Mannschaft lieb gewonnen.
Zu wenig Inklusion bei der Arbeit
Seit 10 Jahren gibt es die Behinderten-Rechts-Konvention.
Was hat sich seitdem in Deutschland verändert ?
Seit 10 Jahren gibt es die UN-Behinderten-Rechts-Konvention.
Das ist ein wichtiger Vertrag.
177 Länder haben diesen Vertrag unterschrieben.
Der Vertrag gilt auch in Deutschland.
Darin steht: Menschen mit Behinderungen haben die gleichen Rechte wie alle anderen Menschen.
Das gilt für alle Lebens-Bereiche:
für die Schule, die Arbeit und beim Wohnen.
Wenn alle Menschen überall mitmachen können, dann nennt man das Inklusion.
Inklusion ist ein Menschen-Recht.
Auch Deutschland soll die UN-Behinderten-Rechts-Konvention umsetzen.
Das versucht Deutschland seit 10 Jahren.
Aktuell fragen sich viele Menschen: Was hat Deutschland bei der Inklusion erreicht ?
Zum Beispiel beim Thema Arbeit ?
Das Institut für Menschen-Rechte hat diese Fragen beantwortet.
Die Fachleute dort sagen: Deutschland tut zu wenig beim Thema Arbeit.
Inklusion findet auf dem 1. Arbeits-Markt kaum statt.
Die Fachleute geben dafür diese Beispiele:
• Menschen mit einer anerkannten Schwerbehinderung sind oft Jahre lang arbeitslos.
• Immer mehr Menschen arbeiten in Behinderten-Werkstätten.
Warum ist das so ?
Und was muss sich ändern ?
Die taz spricht darüber mit Annelie Buntenbach.
Sie arbeitet beim Deutschen Gewerkschafts-Bund.
Sie kennt sich mit den Themen Arbeit und Politik aus.
Die taz erklärt: 37000 deutsche Unternehmen stellen keine Menschen mit Behinderungen ein.
Dabei gibt es dazu ein Gesetz in Deutschland.
Das Gesetz gilt für alle Unternehmen mit über 20 Mitarbeitern.
In dem Gesetz steht: 5 Prozent der Mitarbeiter müssen eine anerkannte Schwerbehinderung haben.
Das heißt: Einer von 20 Mitarbeitern muss schwerbehindert sein.
Aber viele Unternehmen halten sich nicht an das Gesetz.
Sie bezahlen lieber eine Geld-Strafe, weil sie keine Menschen mit Behinderungen einstellen.
Deshalb sind viele Menschen mit Behinderungen arbeitslos.
Frau Buntenbach sagt dazu: Die Geld-Strafe ist zu niedrig.
Die Unternehmen müssen mehr Verantwortung übernehmen.
Sie sollen mehr Geld bezahlen, wenn sie keine Menschen mit Schwerbehinderung einstellen.
Frau Buntenbach sagt aber auch: Es gibt kleine Fortschritte beim Thema Inklusion.
Einige Unternehmen sind offener geworden.
Und es gibt auch bessere Ausbildungs-Möglichkeiten für Menschen mit Behinderungen.
Deshalb arbeiten heute mehr Menschen mit Behinderungen auf dem 1. Arbeits-Markt.
Trotzdem gibt es noch viel zu tun bei der Ausbildung und bei der Arbeits-Suche.
Und die Arbeitgeber müssen noch mehr über Inklusion erfahren.
Die taz erklärt: 270000 Menschen arbeiten in Behinderten-Werkstätten.
Das sind mehr Menschen als vor 10 Jahren.
Sie bekommen meistens keinen Mindestlohn.
Sie verdienen oft unter 200 Euro im Monat.
Frau Buntenbach sagt dazu: Wir brauchen die Behinderten-Werkstätten.
Nicht alle Menschen mit Behinderungen sind arbeitsfähig.
Sie finden einfach keine Arbeit auf dem 1. Arbeits-Markt.
Diese Menschen brauchen eine Werkstatt-Beschäftigung.
Deshalb gibt es auch keinen Mindestlohn.
Sonst würden die Werkstätten genau prüfen, welche Beschäftigen sie einstellen.
Dann ist die Werkstatt nicht mehr offen für alle.
Frau Buntenbach sagt aber auch: Viele Menschen mit Behinderungen sind arbeitsfähig.
Sie können auf dem 1. Arbeits-Markt arbeiten.
Sie dürfen nicht in der Werkstatt feststecken.
Die Werkstätten müssen diese Menschen stärker unterstützen bei der Ausbildung und Arbeits-Suche.
Lasst die Freibäder offen !
Viele Gemeinden in Deutschland haben wenig Geld.
Deshalb müssen immer mehr Freibäder schließen.
Das darf nicht passieren !
Freibäder sind wichtig !
Wie toll so ein Freibad ist !
Das Wasser im Becken leuchtet hellblau.
Der Rasen ist schön grün und frisch gemäht.
Und es gibt viel zu sehen:
Überall laufen, liegen und schwimmen Menschen.
Sie springen von hohen Sprung-Brettern ins Wasser.
So ein Freibad begleitet Menschen das ganze Leben lang.
Hier lernen sie schwimmen und treffen Freunde.
Hier finden sie Ruhe nach einem stressigen Tag.
Aber im Jahr 2017 mussten 62 Freibäder schließen.
Das nennt man auch: Bäder-Sterben.
Wieso schließen die Freibäder ?
Weil sie viel Geld kosten.
Das Personal und der Strom kosten viel Geld.
Und viele Freibäder sind alt und müssen erneuert werden.
Auch diese Bau-Arbeiten kosten viel Geld.
Und all das Geld muss jemand bezahlen.
Freibäder nehmen zwar Eintritt ein, aber diese Einnahmen reichen oft nicht aus.
Die Kosten für den Betrieb sind höher als die Einnahmen.
Jeder soll sich den Eintritt leisten können
Unser taz-Autor findet: Klar, man könnte jetzt mehr Eintritt nehmen.
Aber das Tolle am Freibad ist ja die demokratische Idee dahinter.
Das bedeutet: Jeder kann sich den Eintritt leisten.
So treffen ganz unterschiedliche Menschen aufeinander.
Sie alle können im Freibad ein Teil von der Gesellschaft sein.
Deshalb dürfen Freibäder nicht schließen !
Freibäder gehören zu den Städten und Gemeinden.
Die Städte und Gemeinden haben eine Pflicht:
Sie müssen die Freibäder mit Geld unterstützen.
Sie müssen Freibäder genauso unterstützen wie Büchereien, Museen und Theater.
Viele Städte und Gemeinden tun das auch.
Sie geben bei 3 Euro Eintritt ungefähr 6 Euro dazu.
Das ist insgesamt viel Geld für die Städte und Gemeinden.
Die Städte und Gemeinden haben immer weniger Geld
Das Problem dabei ist: Viele Städte und Gemeinden müssen Geld sparen.
Und wo sparen sie zuerst ?
Bei den Freibädern.
Denn die Freibäder gehören zu den freiwilligen Aufgaben.
Das bedeutet: Die Freibäder sind ein Extra für die Bürger.
Aber die Städte und Gemeinden müssen sie nicht unbedingt betreiben.
Unser taz-Autor findet das sehr schade.
Denn wenn die Freibäder sterben, dann stirbt auch ein Ort für die Gemeinschaft.
Proteste im Hambacher Forst
Der Energie-Konzern RWE will einen Wald fällen.
Viele Menschen protestieren dagegen.
In Nordrhein-Westfalen gibt es einen Wald.
Der Wald heißt Hambacher Forst.
Der Wald war mal sehr groß.
Er war so groß wie 17-Tausend Fußball-Felder.
Dann fällte ein Energie-Konzern die Bäume.
Heute ist der Wald deshalb viel kleiner.
Heute ist der Wald nur noch so groß wie 280 Fußball-Felder.
Warum ist der Hambacher Forst heute so klein ?
In der Erde im Hambacher Forst gibt es Braun-Kohle.
Der Energie-Konzern RWE will diese Braun-Kohle abbauen.
Warum ?
Der Energie-Konzern will Strom aus der Braun-Kohle erzeugen.
Deshalb fällt der Energie-Konzern die Bäume im Hambacher Forst.
Viele Menschen wollen den Hambacher Forst retten.
Sie protestieren, damit nicht noch mehr Bäume gefällt werden.
Wie machen sie das genau ?
Die Menschen besetzen seit 6 Jahren den Hambacher Forst.
Das heißt: Sie wohnen auf den Bäumen in Baum-Häusern.
Sie haben die Baum-Häuser selbst gebaut.
Die Menschen verhindern so, dass die Bäume gefällt werden.
Denn: Wenn Menschen auf einem Baum wohnen, dann darf der Baum nicht gefällt werden.
Es gibt mehr als 30 Baum-Häuser im Hambacher Forst.
Insgesamt können mehr als 100 Menschen dort schlafen und leben.
Es gibt noch mehr Gründe für den Protest
Die Menschen protestieren noch aus einem anderen Grund.
Sie sind gegen die Strom-Erzeugung mit Braun-Kohle.
Warum ?
Braun-Kohle ist eine Quelle zur Strom-Erzeugung.
Andere Quellen sind zum Beispiel Atom-Kraft oder Wind-Kraft.
Bei der Strom-Erzeugung mit Braun-Kohle kommen viele schädliche Stoffe in die Luft.
Das ist schlecht für die Umwelt und für das Klima.
Deshalb soll es in Deutschland bald keinen Strom mehr aus Braun-Kohle geben.
Das hat die Politik in Deutschland so entschieden.
Deshalb sagen die Menschen, die im Hambacher Forst protestieren: Es ist nicht nötig, den Wald jetzt noch abzuholzen.
Die Energie-Erzeugung aus Braun-Kohle hat keine Zukunft.
Polizei geht gegen den Protest vor
Der Protest im Hambacher Forst ist nicht immer friedlich.
Oft gibt es Streit mit Angestellten von dem Energie-Konzern RWE.
Denn die Angestellten wollen den Wald vorbereiten, damit die Bäume gefällt werden können.
Die Polizei hilft dem Energie-Konzern dabei.
Die Polizei versucht dann, die Menschen aus den Baum-Häusern zu holen.
Das läuft nicht immer ohne Streit ab.
Wie ist die aktuelle Lage im Hambacher Forst ?
Aktuell wird der Streit im Hambacher Forst sehr ernst.
Die Polizei hat am 13. und 14. September wieder versucht, die Menschen aus den Bäum-Häusern zu holen.
Hier ist ein Bild davon:
Die Polizei hat dafür die Erlaubnis vom Land Nordrhein-Westfalen.
Das Land Nordrhein-Westfalen sagt: Die Baum-Häuser sind unsicher.
Es könnte im Wald brennen.
Das ist gefährlich für die Menschen.
Diese Begründung vom Land Nordrhein-Westfalen ist seltsam.
Denn es hat in den vergangenen Tagen geregnet.
Es kann also kein Feuer ausbrechen.
Deshalb vermuten viele Menschen: Die Begründung ist eine Ausrede.
Das Land Nordrhein-Westfalen will dem Energie-Konzern RWE dabei helfen, den Wald zu fällen.
Aktuell sind also wieder sehr viele Polizisten im Hambacher Forst.
Sie haben die ersten Baum-Häuser geräumt und zerstört.
Eigentlich sollte das ohne Gewalt passieren.
Das ist den Polizisten nicht gelungen.
Denn die Menschen in den Baum-Häusern wollen bleiben.
Sie wollen weiter für den Wald kämpfen.
Sie klammern sich an die Bäume.
Denn sie kämpfen schon so lange für den Wald.
Viele andere Menschen aus ganz Deutschland sind auch zu den Baum-Häusern gekommen.
Sie protestieren hier vom Boden aus.
Sie wollen zeigen: Wir wollen den Wald auch retten.
Wir unterstützen die Menschen in den Baum-Häusern.
Wie der Protest im Hambacher Forst ausgeht, ist noch nicht sicher.
Das werden die nächsten Tage zeigen.
Gewalt gegen Frauen mit Behinderungen
Frauen mit Behinderungen erleben öfter Gewalt.
Was kann man dagegen tun ?
Die Zeitung taz spricht mit Claudia Chodzinski.
Chodzinski spricht man so aus:
Kod-schins-ki.
Claudia Chodzinski arbeitet beim Frauen-Notruf in Hannover.
Sie hilft dort Frauen, die Gewalt erlebt haben.
Die taz spricht mit Claudia Chodzinski über ihre Arbeit und über Gewalt an Frauen mit Behinderungen.
Claudia Chodzinski sagt: Frauen mit Behinderungen erleben öfter Gewalt als Frauen ohne Behinderungen.
Die Gefühle von Frauen mit Behinderung werden öfter verletzt.
Ihre Körper werden öfter misshandelt.
Warum erleben Frauen mit Behinderungen Gewalt ?
Claudia Chodzinski sagt: Viele Frauen mit Behinderung können sich schlecht gegen Gewalt wehren.
Sie können sich schlechter gegen Gewalt wehren als Frauen ohne Behinderungen.
Das gilt vor allem für Frauen mit einer seelischen Behinderung.
Ein Grund dafür ist: Viele Frauen mit Behinderung sind von anderen Menschen abhängig.
Sie brauchen Hilfe im Alltag.
Sie werden von der Familie oder von Betreuern betreut.
Sie haben dabei oft wenig Privatsphäre.
Zur Privatsphäre gehört zum Beispiel der eigene Körper.
Bei der Betreuung ist oft schwer zu sagen, wo die Privatsphäre beginnt und wo die Privatsphäre aufhört.
Zum Beispiel beim Waschen: Ein Betreuer fasst eine Frau mit Behinderung beim Waschen an, zum Beispiel an den Geschlechts-Organen.
Dabei ist nicht immer klar: Wo genau darf der Betreuer die Frau anfassen ?
Wie darf der Betreuer die Frau anfassen ?
Wo beginnt Gewalt und Misshandlung ?
Wie soll die Frau sagen, wenn sie etwas nicht möchte ?
Manchen Frauen mit Behinderungen fällt es schwer, über Gewalt durch Betreuer zu sprechen.
Manche Frauen können nicht so gut sprechen.
Manche Frauen haben Angst vor dem Betreuer.
Sie sind oft von der Betreuung abhängig.
Claudia Chodzinski berichtet von einem weiteren Beispiel:
Eine Frau mit Behinderungen fühlte sich durch einen Mann bedroht.
Sie wusste nicht, wie sie darüber reden soll.
Sie hat dann aufgehört, sich zu waschen.
Sie dachte: Wenn ich schlecht rieche, fasst mich der Mann nicht mehr an.
Wie kann man den Frauen helfen ?
Claudia Chodzinski will Frauen mit Behinderungen vor Gewalt beschützen.
Dafür hat sie ein Projekt gestartet.
Das Projekt heißt: "Behindert sexuelle Gewalt".
Claudia Chodzinski spricht dabei zum Beispiel mit diesen Personen:
• Betreuern von Menschen mit Behinderungen
• Familien von Frauen mit Behinderungen
• betroffenen Frauen
Sie will Frauen mit Behinderungen dabei unterstützen, über sexuelle Gewalt zu sprechen.
Zum Beispiel über diese Fragen:
• Wo und wie dürfen andere Personen mich anfassen ?
• Welche Rechte habe ich, wenn ich Gewalt erlebe ?
Claudia Chodzinski hofft, dass es so weniger Gewalt gegen Frauen mit Behinderungen gibt.
Bilder über seelische Krankheiten
Menschen mit seelischen Krankheiten sehen in der Zeitung oft traurig aus.
Das muss sich ändern.
Es gibt bessere Bilder.
Franziska Seyboldt hat eine Angst-Störung.
Wie sie damit klarkommt ?
Das erklärt Franziska in diesem Text:
Ich heiße Franziska und habe eine seelische Krankheit.
Ich habe eine Angst-Störung.
Das bedeutet: Ich habe oft Angst, auch wenn es keinen Grund dafür gibt.
Ich habe oft Angst, wenn andere Menschen keine Angst haben.
Ich habe zum Beispiel Angst in der U-Bahn.
Ich habe dann das Gefühl, dass ich keine Luft bekomme.
Warum ich diese Angst habe ?
Das kann ich nicht immer erklären.
Warum finde ich die Bilder über seelische Krankheiten oft schlecht ?
Viele Menschen in Deutschland haben seelische Krankheiten.
In den Zeitungen gibt es viele Texte darüber.
Aber diese Texte ärgern mich oft.
Mein Problem ist: Ich finde die Bilder in den Texten oft schlecht.
Die Bilder verstärken oft Vorurteile über seelische Krankheiten.
Die Bilder zeigen zum Beispiel: • Menschen, die weinen und in einer Zimmer-Ecke sitzen • Menschen, die sich hinter ihren Händen verstecken • Menschen, die Tabletten nehmen
Diese Art von Bildern wirkt traurig und ablehnend.
Man denkt dann: Menschen mit seelischen Krankheiten geht es immer schlecht.
Menschen mit seelischen Krankheiten sind immer einsam.
Aber das stimmt nicht.
Welche Bilder sind besser geeignet ?
Seelische Krankheiten finden im Kopf statt.
Man kann seelische Krankheiten also nicht sehen.
Deshalb kann man seelische Krankheiten schlecht auf Bildern zeigen.
Aber es gibt auch gute Bilder von Menschen mit seelischen Krankheiten.
Hier ist ein Beispiel aus meinem Leben:
Ich habe einen Text über meine Angst geschrieben.
Und ein Fotograf hat Fotos von mir gemacht.
Die Fotos zeigen, wie ich tanze und lache.
Denn Menschen mit seelischen Krankheiten können auch lachen und glücklich sein.
Solche Bilder will ich in der Zeitung sehen !

Neue Vorsitzende bei den Grünen
Die Partei Die Grünen hat 2 neue Vorsitzende.
Sie wollen eine neue Politik für die Grünen.
Die Grünen haben 2 neue Vorsitzende gewählt.
Die neuen Vorsitzenden heißen: Annalena Baerbock [ gesprochen: Bärbock ] und Robert Habeck.
Die neuen Vorsitzenden sind jung.
Sie haben neue Ideen.
Mit diesen Ideen wollen sie die Partei neu gestalten.
Warum könnte das schwierig werden ?
In der Partei Die Grünen gibt es 2 Gruppen.
Eine Gruppe möchte eine linke Politik.
Diese Gruppe nennt man: Linke.
Eine andere Gruppe möchte auch eine linke Politik.
Doch diese Gruppe möchte sich dabei an andere Parteien anpassen.
Denn diese Gruppe möchte, dass die Grünen in Deutschland mitregieren können.
Diese Gruppe nennt man: Realos.
Linke und Realos streiten oft, wie die Politik bei den Grünen sein soll.
Bisher war es bei den Grünen so:
Ein Vorsitzender kam von den Linken.
Und ein Vorsitzender kam von den Realos.
Sie waren sich bei vielen Themen nicht einig.
Mit den neuen Vorsitzenden ist es bei den Grünen so:
Annalena Baerbock und Robert Habeck sind beide von den Realos.
Sie sind sich bei vielen Themen einig.
Viele Menschen glauben zwar: Annalena Baerbock und Robert Habeck setzen sich nicht für die Politik von der linken Gruppe ein.
Annalena Baerbock und Robert Habeck sagen aber: Wir sprechen auch über linke Themen.
Wir wollen für alle in der Partei sprechen.
Welche Themen sind Annalena Baerbock wichtig ?
Annalena Baerbock ist 37 Jahre alt.
Sie kommt aus dem Bundesland Brandenburg.
Annalena Baerbock findet diese linken Themen wichtig für die Politik der Grünen:
Klima-Schutz und Familien-Nachzug.
Annalena Baerbock will sich für den Klima-Schutz einsetzen.
Sie sagt: Die Grünen müssen noch mehr gegen den Klima-Wandel tun.
Der Klima-Wandel nimmt weiter zu.
Durch die Abgase von Autos und Fabriken steigt die Temperatur auf der Erde.
Es wird immer wärmer.
Das ist gefährlich für die Menschen und für die Natur.
Annalena Baerbock will den Familien-Nachzug für Flüchtlinge.
Was ist der Familien-Nachzug ?
Viele Flüchtlinge kommen alleine nach Deutschland.
Viele Flüchtlinge wollen, dass ihre Familien-Mitglieder später nach Deutschland nachkommen können.
Sie vermissen ihre Eltern, Partner und Kinder.
Außerdem: Viele Familien von Flüchtlingen sind in ihrer Heimat in Gefahr.
Dort gibt es oft Krieg, Verfolgung und Hunger.
Welche Themen sind Robert Habeck wichtig ?
Robert Habeck ist 48 Jahre alt.
Er kommt aus dem Bundesland Schleswig-Holstein.
Robert Habeck findet das linke Thema " Umverteilung " wichtig für die Politik der Grünen.
Das bedeutet: Ärmere Menschen sollen mehr Geld bekommen.
Reichere Menschen sollen mehr Geld abgeben.
Zum Beispiel sollen reichere Menschen mehr Steuern bezahlen.
Rassismus im Alltag
Viele Menschen schreiben aktuell über ihre Rassismus-Erlebnisse in Deutschland.
Sie wollen Aufmerksamkeit für dieses Thema.
Im Internet gibt es die Plattform Twitter.
Viele Menschen veröffentlichen hier Nachrichten.
Sie veröffentlichen kurze Texte, aber auch Videos und Fotos.
Oft geht es dabei um aktuelle Themen.
Aktuell schreiben viele Menschen bei Twitter über Rassismus.
Was ist Rassismus ?
Man spricht zum Beispiel von Rassismus, wenn Menschen wegen ihrer Haut-Farbe oder Herkunft: • benachteiligt werden, • für dumm gehalten werden, • beleidigt werden.
Es gibt verschiedene Formen von Rassismus.
Manche Menschen denken: Du bist anders als ich, weil du anders aussiehst oder woanders herkommst.
Andere Menschen denken: Du bist schlechter als ich, weil du anders aussiehst oder woanders herkommst.
Manche Menschen denken ganz allgemein: Menschen wie du sind schlechter als Menschen wie ich.
Viele Menschen schreiben jetzt über Rassismus in ihrem Alltag.
Sie erzählen, wie sie Rassismus in Deutschland erleben.
Dabei benutzen sie diesen Spruch:
Me Two.
Das spricht man so aus:
Mi Tu.
Das ist Englisch und heißt übersetzt: Ich zwei.
Der Spruch bedeutet: Ich bin nicht nur deutsch.
Ich habe auch eine andere Herkunft.
Und ich bin von Rassismus betroffen.
Auch taz-Autorinnen und Autoren sind davon betroffen.
2 taz-Autorinnen erzählen ihre Erlebnisse bei taz leicht.
Das sind Lin Hierse und Katja Musafiri.
Von welchen Erlebnissen erzählt Lin Hierse ?
Lin Hierse erzählt: In der Schule hatte ich viele schlechte Erlebnisse.
Einmal wollte ich als Prinzessin zum Fasching gehen.
Aber die anderen haben gesagt: In Asien gibt es keine Prinzessinnen.
Dann hat meine Mutter für mich ein Mulan-Kostüm gebastelt.
Mulan ist eine Figur aus einem Film, der in China spielt.
Ich musste also Mulan sein, weil ich so ähnlich aussehe wie sie.
Ich durfte nicht Schneewittchen oder Rapunzel sein.
Ein anderes Mal hat jemand an die Tafel geschrieben: Chinesen sind Hunde-Fresser.
Alle haben mich angeschaut.
Das war mir sehr unangenehm.
Dabei esse ich gar keine Hunde.
Lin Hierse erzählt auch: In der Arbeit und in der Freizeit behandeln mich die Leute manchmal anders.
Sie fragen: Wo kommst du wirklich her ?
Dabei ist die Antwort klar:
Ich bin Deutsche.
Ich komme aus Deutschland.
Von welchen Erlebnissen erzählt Katja Musafiri ?
Katja Musafiri erzählt: Als Kind war ich im Urlaub.
Ein paar Leute haben gesagt: Jetzt trinkt das Vieh auch noch.
Sie meinten nicht die Kuh auf der Wiese.
Sie meinten mich.
Viele Menschen sehen mich voller Ekel an.
Sie beleidigen mich ohne Grund, nur weil ich anders aussehe als sie.
Wenn ich in Not bin, bitte ich nur selten um Hilfe.
Denn ich habe Angst, dass die Menschen mir noch mehr schaden könnten.
Katja Musafiri sagt auch: Ich will nicht mehr schweigen.
Ich will diese Geschichten erzählen.
Die Menschen sollen wissen, wie es mir geht.
Andere Menschen können nicht darüber entscheiden, ob ich Deutsche bin.
Ich bin Deutsche.
Und ich möchte eine gute Zukunft für meinen Sohn.
Keine Angst vor der Masern-Impfung
Der Kinder-Arzt Christof Metzler findet Impfungen wichtig.
Aber er versteht auch die Ängste der Eltern.
Die taz hat mit dem Kinder-Arzt Christof Metzler über Masern gesprochen.
Masern sind eine häufige Krankheit bei Kindern.
Masern werden zum Beispiel beim Niesen über die Luft übertragen.
Wenn ein Kind an Masern erkrankt, dann hat es zum Beispiel diese Krankheits-Anzeichen: Fieber, Husten, Schnupfen und einen juckenden Ausschlag.
Sind Masern gefährlich ?
Ja, Masern können gefährlich werden.
Weltweit sterben jeden Tag ungefähr 400 Kinder an Masern.
Viele Eltern gehen deshalb zum Kinder-Arzt.
Dort bekommen die Kinder eine Masern-Schutz-Impfung.
Das funktioniert so:
Der Arzt gibt den Kindern eine Spritze mit schwachen Masern-Viren.
Ein anderes Wort für Viren ist: Krankheits-Erreger.
Der Körper von dem Kind bekämpft dann die Krankheits-Erreger.
Dabei bildet der Körper Abwehr-Kräfte gegen Masern-Viren.
Das Kind kann nach der Masern-Schutz-Impfung nicht mehr an Masern erkranken.
Kein Vertrauen in die Impfung
Manche Eltern sind gegen die Masern-Schutz-Impfung.
Sie glauben: • Es ist natürlich und gehört zum Leben dazu, dass Kinder Masern bekommen. • Die Masern-Impfung hat viele Nebenwirkungen.
Oft gibt es Streit darüber, ob die Schutz-Impfung gegen Masern gut oder schlecht ist.
Was sagt der Kinder-Arzt Christof Metzler im taz-Gespräch zum Streit ?
Christof Metzler findet die Masern-Schutz-Impfung wichtig.
Er hat dafür mehrere Gründe.
Er sagt: Ja, die Masern-Schutz-Impfung kann Nebenwirkungen haben.
Eine Art Masern-Erkrankung kann ausbrechen.
Aber das ist nur eine schwache Erkrankung und kommt sehr selten vor.
Ohne Schutz-Impfung erkrankt man eher an Masern.
Und dann ist die Masern-Erkrankung stärker und gefährlicher.
Eine Masern-Erkrankung hat zum Beispiel diese Folge:
Lungen-Entzündung.
Trotzdem sind auch einige Ärzte in Deutschland gegen die Masern-Impfung.
Ungefähr 3 von 100 Ärzten sind dagegen.
Christof Metzler versteht diese Ärzte nicht.
Er sagt: Die Masern-Schutz-Impfung ist wichtig.
Denn Masern können für Kinder tödlich sein.
Weitere Kritik an der Masern-Impfung
Eine weitere Kritik gegen die Masern-Schutz-Impfung lautet: Kinder bekommen in den ersten Lebens-Jahren zu viele Schutz-Impfungen.
Denn auch gegen viele andere Krankheiten gibt es eine Schutz-Impfung.
Dazu gehören zum Beispiel: Röteln, Hepatitis B, Grippe, Windpocken oder Mumps.
Sind so viele Schutz-Impfungen gut für ein Kind ?
Christof Metzler sagt dazu: Der Körper von Kindern verträgt mehrere Schutz-Impfungen.
Das Abwehr-System von Kindern hält viel aus.
Die Eltern müssen keine Angst vor Schutz-Impfungen haben.
Die Ängste von den Eltern versteht Christof Metzler trotzdem.
Christof Metzler sagt: Die Eltern wollen nur das Beste für ihr Kind.
Und der Staat und viele Ärzte beraten Eltern oft schlecht über die Schutz-Impfung.
Viele Eltern informieren sich deshalb im Internet.
Aber Informationen im Internet sind manchmal falsch.
Christof Metzler sagt: Wir Ärzte müssen wieder Vertrauen bei Schutz-Impfungen herstellen.
Wir Ärzte müssen Eltern besser informieren.
Klima-Schutz in Europa
Am 26. Mai 2019 ist die Europa-Wahl.
Was sagen die Politiker in Europa vor der Wahl zum Klima-Schutz ?
Aktuell reden viele Menschen über Klima-Schutz.
Sie fragen sich zum Beispiel: Wie kann man das schädliche CO2 verringern ?
CO2 ist eine Art von Abgas.
Es entsteht zum Beispiel beim Heizen und Auto-Fahren, wenn Benzin, Öl oder Gas verbrannt wird.
Zu viel CO2 verändert das Klima auf der Welt.
Warum reden viele Menschen über Klima-Schutz ?
In vielen Städten gibt es freitags Schüler-Proteste.
Die Schüler sind nicht einverstanden mit der Umwelt-Politik und fordern mehr Klima-Schutz.
Die Proteste gibt es in mehreren Ländern in Europa.
Sie heißen: Fridays for Future ( gesprochen: Freideys for Fjutschar ).
Auf Deutsch heißt das: freitags für die Zukunft.
Aktuell gibt es noch mehr Schüler-Proteste in Europa.
Denn am 26. Mai ist die Europa-Wahl.
Und die Schüler fordern zur Wahl: Die Politiker in Europa sollen über Klima-Schutz sprechen.
Sprechen die Politiker über Klima-Schutz ?
Einige Politiker in Europa sprechen über Klima-Schutz, zum Beispiel Emmanuel Macron.
Er ist der Präsident von Frankreich.
Er sieht so aus:
Emmanuel Macron hat diesen Klima-Schutz-Plan:
Europa soll bis zum Jahr 2050 klima-neutral werden.
Das bedeutet: Europa soll bis 2050 den CO2-Ausstoß stark verringern.
Das restliche CO2 soll man ausgleichen, zum Beispiel mit neu gepflanzten Bäumen.
Denn Bäume sind gut für das Klima.
Sie verwandeln CO2 in Sauerstoff und sorgen so für frische Luft.
Was sagen andere Länder in Europa zu diesem Klima-Schutz-Plan ?
8 Länder wollen bei dem Plan mitmachen, zum Beispiel Schweden, Spanien und Portugal.
Sie wollen auch klima-neutral werden.
Aber was ist mit Deutschland ?
Deutschland will bisher nicht mitmachen.
Denn Bundes-Kanzlerin Angela Merkel sagt: Man kann über den Plan nachdenken.
Aber eigentlich hat Deutschland eigene Klima-Schutz-Ziele.
Das Problem bei den deutschen Zielen ist: Deutschland erreicht seine Ziele bisher nicht.
Die Industrie, Heizungen und Autos stoßen noch zu viel CO2 aus.
Eigentlich sollte der CO2-Ausstoß schon weniger sein.
Einige Menschen fordern deshalb neue Lösungen, zum Beispiel eine CO2-Steuer.
Das bedeutet: Wenn Unternehmen CO2 ausstoßen, dann müssen sie dafür Steuern bezahlen.
Die Hoffnung dabei ist: Unternehmen stoßen in Zukunft weniger CO2 aus, damit sie weniger CO2-Steuer zahlen müssen.
Deutschland verliert gegen Mexiko
Die Deutsche Mannschaft verliert das erste WM-Spiel.
Mexikos Mannschaft gewinnt.
Hier alle wichtigen Infos zum Spiel.
Der Frust bei der deutschen Mannschaft ist groß.
Die Mannschaft verliert ihr erstes WM-Spiel.
Hier alle wichtigen Infos zum Spiel.
► Wie ging das Spiel aus ?
Deutschland schießt kein Tor.
Mexiko schießt 1 Tor.
Mexiko gewinnt.
► Wie lief das Spiel ab ?
Die deutsche Mannschaft spielt ein schwaches Spiel.
Vor allem in der ersten Halbzeit.
Die deutschen Spieler wirken müde.
Sie laufen wenig.
Sie sind langsam.
Die deutschen Stürmer haben einige Tor-Chancen.
Doch ihnen fehlt der Wille und die Leidenschaft.
Sie schießen kein Tor.
Mexikos Spieler sind jedoch hellwach.
Mexikos Spieler schießen immer wieder auf das deutsche Tor.
Die deutschen Verteidiger haben viel zu tun.
Sie verhindern einige Tore von Mexiko.
Doch immer gelingt das nicht.
Mexikos Stürmer Hirving Lozano greift immer wieder an.
In Minute 35 ist Hirving Lozano dann erfolgreich.
Er schießt und trifft.
Der deutsche Torwart Manuel Neuer hat keine Chance.
Er kann den Ball nicht halten.
Mexikos Tor bleibt das einzige Tor im Spiel.
Mexiko kann den Vorsprung bis zum Ende halten.
Mexiko gewinnt verdient.
Es ist Mexikos erster Sieg bei einer WM gegen Deutschland.
► Wer ist der wichtigste Spieler im Spiel ?
Natürlich Hirving Lozano von der mexikanischen Mannschaft.
Er schoss das Tor für Mexiko.
Er zeigte keine Angst vor dem starken Gegner Deutschland.
Das Foto zeigt ihn nach dem Tor:
► Was bedeutet Mexikos Sieg für die deutsche Mannschaft ?
Viele Menschen haben vor dem Spiel gedacht: Mexiko ist ein leichter Gegner.
Die deutsche Mannschaft gewinnt auf jeden Fall gegen Mexiko.
Das war falsch.
Die deutsche Mannschaft hat verloren.
Bald spielt Deutschland gegen Schweden und Südkorea.
Wenn Deutschland dann auch so schwach spielt, werden Schweden und Südkorea zu gefährlichen Gegnern.
Kroatien gewinnt gegen England
Kroatien hat es geschafft.
Die Mannschaft zieht ins WM-Finale ein.
Kroatien hat es geschafft.
Die Mannschaft zieht ins WM-Finale ein.
Hier alle wichtigen Infos zum Spiel.
► Wie ging das Spiel aus ?
England schießt 1 Tor.
Kroatien schießt 2 Tore.
Kroatien gewinnt das Spiel.
► Wie lief das Spiel ab ?
England macht schon in der 5. Spiel-Minute das erste Tor.
England macht das Tor aus einer Standard-Situation heraus.
Was ist eine Standard-Situation ?
Standard-Situationen gibt es meist nach einer Spiel-Unterbrechung.
Der Schiedsrichter pfeift, weil der Ball im Aus ist oder es ein Foul ( gesprochen: Faul ) gab.
Danach gibt es einen Einwurf, Eckstoß oder Freistoß.
Das nennt man eine Standard-Situtation.
Die englische Mannschaft bekommt also zu Spiel-Beginn gleich einen Freistoß.
Und der Ball landet im Tor.
Englang führt.
Kroatien hingegen macht viele Fehler.
Die kroatischen Spieler verlieren oft den Ball.
Und zwischen den kroatischen Spielern ist zu viel Abstand.
Sie können sich den Ball deshalb nicht genau genug zuschießen.
In den ersten 45 Minuten des Spiels ändert sich daran nichts.
Und auch die zweite Halbzeit läuft so weiter:
Die Engländer haben Tor-Chancen.
Die Kroaten machen Fehler.
Erst in der 68. Minute ändert sich das.
Da bekommt der kroatische Spieler Šime Vrsaljko den Ball.
Und er trifft.
England und Kroatien haben nun gleich viele Tore.
Wegen des Tor-Gleichstands gibt es eine Spiel-Verlängerung.
Das Spiel dauert 30 Minuten länger.
In der Verlängerung gelingt Kroatien dann der Sieg.
Der Spieler Mario Mandžukić schießt den Ball ins Tor.
Kroatien zieht ins Finale ein.
England ist draußen.
Die Pille für den Mann
Die Pille ist ein beliebtes Verhütungs-Mittel.
Aber für Frauen hat sie viele Neben-Wirkungen.
Wo bleibt die Pille für den Mann ?
Eine Frau und ein Mann haben Sex.
Sie wollen dabei aber keine Kinder zeugen.
Wie verhindern sie eine Schwangerschaft ?
Sie können Verhütungs-Mittel benutzen.
Es gibt viele verschiedene Verhütungs-Mittel.
Es gibt zum Beispiel Kondome, Spritzen, Pflaster und noch vieles mehr.
Auch die Anti-Baby-Pille schützt vor Schwangerschaften.
Diese Pille gibt es seit über 50 Jahren.
Sie ist ein Medikament.
Ein Arzt schreibt ein Rezept für die Pille.
Frauen kaufen die Pille mit dem Rezept in der Apotheke.
Wie nehmen Frauen die Pille ein ?
Frauen nehmen die Pille einmal am Tag.
Sie nehmen die Pille 21 Tage lang.
Danach machen sie für 7 Tage eine Pause.
In dieser Zeit bekommt die Frau ihre Periode.
Was bewirkt die Pille im weiblichen Körper ?
Durch die Pille kommen Hormone in den Körper.
Diese Hormone verhindern den Ei-Sprung.
Das bedeutet: Es gibt keine Ei-Zelle, die beim Sex befruchtet werden kann.
Die Frau kann also nicht schwanger werden.
Die Pille hat auch Nachteile
Die Pille ist ein beliebtes und sicheres Verhütungs-Mittel.
Aber nicht alles ist gut an der Pille.
Denn es gibt die Pille nur für Frauen, nicht für Männer.
Das bedeutet: Viele Frauen müssen sich allein um die Verhütung kümmern.
Sie tragen dabei sehr viel Verantwortung.
Sie müssen viel Geld für die Pille bezahlen.
Sie müssen die Pille regelmäßig schlucken.
Und sie müssen mit den Neben-Wirkungen umgehen.
Zu den Neben-Wirkungen gehören zum Beispiel: • Übelkeit • Kopf-Schmerzen • Brust-Schmerzen • unregelmäßige Blutungen • schlechte Stimmung • weniger Lust auf Sex
Wo bleibt die Pille für Männer ?
Immer weniger junge Frauen nehmen die Pille.
Manche Menschen fragen sich deshalb: Warum gibt es keine Pille für Männer ?
In Wirklichkeit sucht die Forschung schon seit Jahren nach einem Verhütungs-Mittel für Männer.
Forscher auf der ganzen Welt forschen daran.
Zum Beispiel in China, Indien und den USA.
Diese Verhütungs-Mittel für Männer werden aktuell erforscht:
• Pillen
• Salben
• Spritzen
• kleine Schalter im Hoden, die den Spermien-Fluss stoppen
Welche Probleme gibt es bei der Forschung ?
Große Unternehmen
Große Unternehmen bestimmen den Medikamenten-Markt.
Sie entscheiden: Soll ein Medikament in den Verkauf gehen oder nicht ?
Dabei ist für die Unternehmen wichtig, welches Medikament viel Geld einbringt.
Die Anti-Baby-Pille bringt aktuell viel Geld ein.
Das wollen die Unternehmen nicht ändern.
Deshalb bezahlen die Unternehmen nur wenig oder gar kein Geld für die Forschung an Verhütungs-Mitteln für Männer.
Strenge Regeln
Außerdem gibt es strenge Regeln in der Medikamenten-Forschung.
Diese 2 Regeln sind dabei besonders wichtig:
• Das Medikament muss genau getestet werden.
• Das Medikament darf nur wenige Neben-Wirkungen haben.
In jedem Land sind diese Regeln unterschiedlich streng.
Und oft werden diese Regeln noch strenger.
Manchmal müssen Forscher ihre Arbeit dann neu beginnen.
In Indien gibt es zum Beispiel den Forscher Sujoy Guha.
Er forscht seit Jahren an einem Verhütungs-Mittel für Männer.
Er hat eine Gel-Creme erfunden, die den Weg zum Penis verstopft.
So können die Spermien nicht mehr fließen.
Sujoy Guha war oft schon fast fertig mit seiner Erfindung.
Aber dann kamen immer neue Regeln und Sujoy Guha musste mehrfach von vorne anfangen.
Vorurteile
Auch Vorurteile sind ein Problem bei der Pille für Männer.
Oft sind diese Vorurteile FALSCH.
Aber es gibt sie.
Und sie beeinflussen die öffentliche Meinung.
Zum Beispiel gibt es diese Vorurteile:
1. Männer können nicht mal ihre Socken aufheben.
Wie sollen sie dann regelmäßig an die Pille denken ?
2. Männer können nicht schwanger werden.
Also interessieren sie sich auch nicht für Verhütung.
3. Auch wenn Männer die Pille nehmen wollen, dann würden Frauen ihnen bei der Einnahme nicht vertrauen.
Forscher wollten diese Vorurteile nicht glauben.
Sie haben deshalb viele Menschen dazu befragt.
Die meisten Menschen haben gesagt: Sie wollen eine Pille für Männer.
Wie sieht die Zukunft aus ?
Bis die Pille für Männer verkauft wird, müssen noch viele Probleme gelöst werden.
Aber manche Männer wollen nicht warten.
Zum Beispiel sagt eine Gruppe von Männern in Frankreich: Wir wollen jetzt schon etwas tun !
Diese Männer-Gruppe in Frankreich hat besondere Unterhosen gebastelt.
Diese Unterhosen sind eine Art Verhütungs-Mittel.
Denn die Unterhosen wärmen die Hoden.
Dadurch werden auch die Spermien warm.
Spermien vertragen keine Hitze.
Die Hitze schadet den Spermien.
So kann eine Schwangerschaft verhindert werden.
An Schulen fehlen Lehrer
An vielen Schulen in Deutschland fehlen Lehrer.
Sie werden oft durch Quer-Einsteiger ersetzt.
Ist das gut ?
Schulen in Deutschland haben ein Problem:
Sie haben zu wenige Lehrer.
In Deutschland fehlen ungefähr 40 Tausend Lehrer.
Das nennt man auch: Lehrer-Mangel.
Ein Grund für den Lehrer-Mangel ist, dass zu wenige Menschen eine Ausbildung zum Lehrer machen.
Schulen haben verschiedene Lösungen für den Lehrer-Mangel.
Zum Beispiel: • Es gibt weniger Unterricht für die Schüler. • Es gibt größere Schul-Klassen. • Es unterrichten wieder Lehrer, die bereits in Rente waren. • Es unterrichten angehende Lehrer, die noch keinen Berufs-Abschluss haben.
Oft wird auch diese Lösung ausprobiert:
Schulen stellen Quer-Einsteiger als Lehrer ein.
Quer-Einsteiger haben den Lehrer-Beruf nicht studiert.
Sie haben nur ein Fach studiert, zum Beispiel Geschichte, Deutsch oder Mathe.
Sie haben aber nicht gelernt, wie man Kinder und Jugendliche unterrichtet.
Sie haben nicht gelernt, wie man anderen etwas beibringt.
Viele Quer-Einsteiger machen deshalb eine Weiter-Bildung.
Sie lernen hier den Lehrer-Beruf.
Sie lernen, zu unterrichten und richtig mit Kindern und Jugendlichen umzugehen.
Man nennt das auch: pädagogische Ausbildung.
Unterschiedliche Meinungen zu Quer-Einsteigern
Es gibt unterschiedliche Meinungen zu Quer-Einsteigern.
Einige Menschen finden: Quer-Einsteiger sind toll für den Lehrer-Beruf.
Sie haben vielleicht schon woanders gearbeitet.
Sie haben vielleicht einen praktischen Blick auf ihre Fächer.
Sie bringen andere Erfahrungen mit als die anderen Lehrer.
Aber: Die Politik muss sich darum kümmern, dass die Quer-Einsteiger eine gute pädagogische Ausbildung bekommen.
Einige Menschen finden aber: Quer-Einsteiger sind auf Dauer keine Lösung für den Lehrer-Mangel.
In jedem Bundes-Land ist die Weiter-Bildung anders.
Nicht jede Weiter-Bildung hat eine gute Qualität.
Nicht immer sind Quer-Einsteiger danach für den Unterricht bereit.
Schulen brauchen gut ausgebildete Lehrer.
Außerdem werden seit ein paar Jahren wieder mehr Kinder in Deutschland geboren.
In Zukunft gibt es also mehr Schüler.
Und es werden noch mehr Lehrer gebraucht.
Die Politik muss sich endlich kümmern.
Sie muss den Lehrer-Beruf beliebter machen.
Sie muss dafür sorgen, dass mehr Menschen eine Ausbildung zum Lehrer machen.
Zum Beispiel durch mehr Studien-Plätze in der Lehrer-Ausbildung an den Universitäten.
Und durch eine bessere Bezahlung der fertig ausgebildeten Lehrer.
Deutschland verliert gegen Südkorea
Die deutsche Mannschaft scheidet aus der WM aus.
Schweden und Mexiko sind weiter im Achtel-Finale.
Deutschland scheidet aus der WM aus.
Die deutsche Mannschaft konnte nicht gegen Südkorea gewinnen.
Hier alle wichtigen Infos zum Spiel.
► Wie ging das Spiel aus ?
Deutschland schießt kein Tor.
Südkorea schießt 2 Tore.
Südkorea gewinnt.
► Wie war die Situation vor dem Spiel ?
Deutschland spielt in einer Gruppe mit Mexiko, Schweden und Südkorea.
Vor dem Spiel ist keine von den Mannschaften sicher weiter.
Alle Mannschaften können noch in das Achtel-Finale kommen.
Und alle Mannschaften können noch aus der WM ausscheiden.
Die deutsche Mannschaft will deshalb gegen Südkorea gewinnen.
Aber die deutsche Mannschaft ist auch unsicher.
► Wie lief das Spiel ab ?
In der ersten Halbzeit schießt keine Mannschaft ein Tor.
Deutschland hat öfter den Ball.
Aber Südkorea hat ein paar Chancen.
Auch im Spiel Mexiko gegen Schweden gibt es in der ersten Halbzeit keine Tore.
Deshalb ist noch alles möglich.
In der zweiten Halbzeit schießt Schweden 3 Tore gegen Mexiko.
Das heißt: Die deutsche Mannschaft muss gewinnen.
Sonst ist sie raus aus der WM.
Aber die deutschen Spieler machen viele Fehler.
Sie sind langsam.
In der Nachspielzeit schießt Südkorea 1 Tor.
Bei einer Ecke trifft der Südkoreaner Younggwon Kim.
Danach laufen alle deutschen Spieler nach vorne.
Auch der Torwart Manuel Neuer.
Das Tor steht frei.
Und der Südkoreaner Heungmin Son kann noch 1 Tor schießen.
Damit hat Südkorea am Ende von dem Spiel 2 Tore.
Die deutschen Spieler sind nach dem Spiel sehr enttäuscht.
Sie können jetzt nicht weiter in der WM spielen.
Deutschland ist die letzte Mannschaft in der Gruppe.
Südkorea kann auch nicht weiter in der WM spielen.
Schweden und Mexiko sind weiter im Achtel-Finale.
Wenn Medikamente nicht wirken
Kranke sterben oft, weil Medikamente nicht wirken.
Ein Grund sind bestimmte Keime.
Auf der Welt gibt es sehr viele Keime.
Was sind Keime ?
Keime sind Krankheits-Erreger.
Keime sieht man nicht mit dem bloßen Auge.
Keime sind in der Luft und im Wasser.
Keime können Menschen krank machen.
Zum Beispiel, wenn die Keime in eine Wunde gelangen.
Keime können mit Medikamenten behandelt werden.
Diese Medikamente heißen: Antibiotika.
Ein großes Problem ist: Es gibt immer mehr Keime, bei denen Antibiotika nicht wirken.
Man sagt dann: Diese Keime sind resistent.
Die Keime sind widerstandsfähig gegen Antibiotika.
Warum gibt es immer mehr widerstandsfähige Keime ?
Warum wirken die Antibiotika nicht ?
Ein Grund dafür ist: Deutsche Ärzte verschreiben große Mengen Antibiotika an kranke Menschen.
Die Keime sind deshalb immer öfter Antibiotika ausgesetzt.
Die Keime gewöhnen sich an diese Antibiotika.
Und die Keime entwickeln Abwehr-Kräfte gegen diese Antibiotika.
Die Folge davon ist: Antibiotika helfen nicht mehr gegen diese Keime.
Antibiotika heilen kranke Menschen nicht mehr.
An widerstandsfähigen Keimen sterben jedes Jahr 15000 Menschen in Deutschland.
Ein weiteres Problem ist: Widerstandsfähige Keime verbreiten sich schnell.
Sie verbreiten sich schnell in der Umwelt.
Kranke Menschen geben diese Keime weiter.
Und auch Tiere geben widerstandsfähige Keime weiter.
Wie geben Tiere widerstandsfähige Keime weiter ?
Rinder, Schweine und Hühner bekommen auf Bauern-Höfen oft Antibiotika.
Zum Beispiel gegen Krankheiten oder damit sie schneller wachsen.
Die Tiere entwickeln mit der Zeit ebenfalls widerstandsfähige Keime.
Über die Tier-Ausscheidungen gelangen die Keime in die Gülle.
Die Gülle wird zum Düngen der Felder benutzt.
Die Gülle wird dort vom Regen in Gewässer geleitet.
Zum Beispiel in Flüsse und Seen.
Der Fernsehsender NDR hat herausgefunden: In vielen deutschen Gewässern gibt es widerstandsfähige Keime.
Seehofers Plan zur Flüchtlings-Politik
Der Innen-Minister Horst Seehofer stellt einen Plan vor.
Er will weniger Flüchtlinge in Deutschland.
Horst Seehofer hat einen Plan vorgestellt.
Horst Seehofer ist von der Partei CSU.
Und er ist der deutsche Innen-Minister.
Seine Aufgaben sind zum Beispiel: • für die Sicherheit in Deutschland sorgen, also gegen Terrorismus und andere Straftaten vorgehen • Lösungen für Krisen finden, zum Beispiel nach Natur-Katastrophen
Was steht in dem Plan von Horst Seehofer ?
Horst Seehofer nennt seinen Plan: Masterplan.
In dem Plan geht es um die Flüchtlings-Politik.
Seit dem Jahr 2015 kommen viele Flüchtlinge nach Europa.
Viele Flüchtlinge kommen aus Syrien und Nord-Afrika.
Sie fliehen vor Verfolgung, Krieg und schlechten Lebens-Bedingungen.
Viele Flüchtlinge kommen auch nach Deutschland.
Sie beantragen hier Asyl.
Das Wort Asyl bedeutet Zuflucht.
Wenn Flüchtlinge Asyl bekommen, dann dürfen sie erst mal in Deutschland bleiben.
Das will Horst Seehofer mit seinem Plan ändern.
Horst Seehofer will: • Weniger Flüchtlinge sollen nach Deutschland kommen und hier bleiben können. • Und weniger Flüchtlinge sollen Asyl beantragen und Asyl bekommen können.
Dafür hat Horst Seehofer 63 Ziele festgelegt.
Hier sind einige dieser Zielen im Überblick:
Grenz-Kontrollen einführen
Laut dem Plan von Horst Seehofer soll an den deutschen Grenzen Folgendes passieren:
Die Grenzen sollen stärker bewacht werden.
Dafür soll die deutsche Polizei zusammen-arbeiten mit der Polizei aus den Nachbar-Ländern.
Sie sollen Flüchtlinge an den Grenzen aufhalten.
Auch die Grenzen von Europa sollen besser bewacht werden.
Viele Flüchtlinge kommen zum Beispiel in Booten über das Mittelmeer nach Spanien und Italien.
Viele von diesen Booten kommen aus Nord-Afrika.
Aber diese Boote mit Flüchtlingen sollen zurück nach Nord-Afrika geschickt werden.
Anker-Zentren einrichten
In dem Plan von Horst Seehofer steht außerdem: Über Asyl-Anträge soll schneller entschieden werden.
Es soll also schneller entschieden werden: Darf ein Flüchtling in Deutschland bleiben ?
Oder muss er zurück in sein Heimat-Land ?
Dafür sollen Flüchtlinge nach ihrer Ankunft in Deutschland in eine besondere Unterkunft kommen.
Horst Seehofer nennt diese Unterkunft Anker-Zentrum.
Das Wort Anker ist eine Abkürzung für: Ankunft, Entscheidung und Rückführung.
Im Anker-Zentrum sollen Flüchtlinge ihren Asyl-Antrag stellen.
Und der Asyl-Antrag soll schnell bearbeitet werden.
Dafür soll es in den Anker-Zentren alle notwendigen Behörden und Gerichte geben.
Transit-Zentren für Flüchtlinge
Viele Flüchtlinge wollen in Deutschland Asyl beantragen.
Aber einige Flüchtlinge haben schon Asyl beantragt.
Sie waren vorher schon in einem anderen EU-Land.
Dort wurden zuerst ihre Daten erfasst.
Und dann haben sie einen Asyl-Antrag gestellt.
Laut dem Plan von Horst Seehofer soll in diesen Fällen Folgendes passieren:
Diese Flüchtlinge kommen in eine besondere Unterkunft.
Horst Seehofer nennt diese Unterkunft Transit-Zentrum.
Das Wort Transit bezeichnet Orte, an denen man nur für kurze Zeit ist.
Flüchtlinge sollen in den Transit-Zentren für bis zu 48 Stunden bleiben.
Danach werden die Flüchtlinge in das EU-Land zurückgeschickt, in dem sie den 1. Asyl-Antrag gestellt haben.
Es ist aber noch nicht sicher, ob die anderen EU-Länder dabei mitmachen und diese Flüchtlinge wieder zurücknehmen.
Wie sind die Meinungen zum Plan von Horst Seehofer ?
Es gibt unterschiedliche Meinungen zu dem Plan.
Viele Ziele von Horst Seehofer werden kritisiert, besonders die Transit-Zentren und Grenz-Kontrollen.
Deshalb ist es noch nicht sicher, ob der Plan umgesetzt wird.
Welche Kritik gibt es genau ?
Viele Menschen finden den Plan von Horst Seehofer unmenschlich.
Flüchtlings- und Hilfs-Organisationen sagen zum Beispiel: Flüchtlinge fliehen oft vor Verfolgung und Krieg.
Sie brauchen dringend Hilfe.
Abweisung und Grenz-Kontrollen helfen Flüchtlingen nicht.
Das macht die Situation für Flüchtlinge nur noch schlimmer.
Eine weitere Kritik lautet: Horst Seehofer hat seinen Plan nicht gut abgesprochen.
Politiker von den Parteien CDU und SPD sagen: Horst Seehofer hat seinen Plan nicht mit uns abgesprochen.
Warum ist das wichtig ?
Die Parteien CDU und SPD sind mit der CSU in einer Regierung.
Die 3 Parteien entscheiden gemeinsam über die deutsche Politik.
Horst Seehofer darf also nicht alleine über die Flüchtlings-Politik entscheiden.
Vertrag von CDU, CSU und SPD
Die Parteien CDU, CSU und SPD wollen zusammen in Deutschland regieren.
Deshalb haben die Parteien einen Vertrag gemacht.
Die Parteien CDU, CSU und SPD haben bei der Bundestags-Wahl viele Stimmen bekommen.
Die Parteien haben zusammen mehr als die Hälfte der Stimmen.
CDU, CSU und SPD können deshalb eine Regierung bilden.
Diese Parteien bestimmen dann die Politik in Deutschland.
Wenn mehrere Parteien eine Regierung bilden, nennt man das auch: Koalition.
Bevor die Parteien zusammen eine Koalition bilden, sprechen sie über viele wichtige Themen.
Sie sprechen über ihre Ziele für die nächsten 4 Jahre.
Sie schreiben die Ziele in einen Koalitions-Vertrag.
Der Koalitions-Vertrag von CDU, CSU und SPD ist jetzt fertig.
Viele Mitglieder in der SPD sind unzufrieden mit dem Koalitions-Vertrag.
Sie finden: Im Koalitions-Vertrag stehen zu wenige Ziele, die für die SPD wichtig sind.
Die SPD-Mitglieder wollen deshalb über den Koalitions-Vertrag abstimmen.
Wenn über die Hälfte der Mitglieder gegen den Vertrag stimmt, gibt es keine Koalition von CDU, CSU und SPD.
Was steht im Koalitions-Vertrag von CDU, CSU und SPD ?
CDU, CSU und SPD haben über viele Themen verhandelt.
Der Koalitions-Vertrag ist sehr lang.
Er ist 177 Seiten lang.
Im Koalitions-Vertrag geht es zum Beispiel um diese Themen:
• Bildung
• Pflege
• Arbeit
• Wohnen
• Internet
Was steht im Koalitions-Vertrag zum Thema Bildung ?
Ein Ziel ist: CDU, CSU und SPD wollen mehr Geld für Bildung ausgeben.
Sie wollen Schulen ausbauen.
Wie wollen sie die Schulen ausbauen ?
Es soll mehr Ganztags-Schulen geben.
Das bedeutet: Mehr Schüler werden den ganzen Tag in der Schule betreut.
Dann können beide Elternteile den ganzen Tag arbeiten.
Das ist vor allem für viele Mütter ein Vorteil.
Sie bleiben bisher oft am Nachmittag Zuhause, um ihre Kinder zu betreuen.
Außerdem soll es für Schulen mehr Computer geben.
Die Computer sollen den Schul-Unterricht erleichtern.
Und sie sollen die Schüler auf die Arbeit mit Computern im Berufsleben vorbereiten.
Was steht im Koalitions-Vertrag zum Thema Pflege ?
Ein Ziel ist: CDU, CSU und SPD wollen 8000 neue Arbeits-Plätze in der Pflege schaffen.
Viele Menschen kümmern sich um kranke und ältere Menschen.
Das nennt man: Pflege.
Aktuell gibt es nicht genug Menschen, die als Pflege-Kräfte arbeiten.
CDU, CSU und SPD wollen, dass mehr Menschen in der Pflege arbeiten.
Was steht im Koalitions-Vertrag zum Thema Arbeit ?
Ein Arbeits-Vertrag gibt Menschen eine Sicherheit im Beruf.
Die Menschen wissen dann, wie viel Geld sie bekommen und wie lange sie arbeiten.
Viele Menschen haben einen befristeten Arbeits-Vertrag.
Ein befristeter Arbeits-Vertrag gilt nur für eine festgelegte Zeit.
Die Menschen wissen nicht, was danach mit ihrem Arbeits-Platz passiert.
Sie haben wenig Sicherheit in ihrem Beruf.
Gegen befristete Arbeits-Verträge wollen die CDU und die CSU nicht viel tun.
Die SPD kann sich hier nicht durchsetzen.
Die SPD kann befristete Arbeits-Verträge nicht abschaffen.
Was steht im Koalitions-Vertrag zum Thema Wohnen ?
Ein Ziel ist: CDU, CSU und SPD wollen Vermieter daran hindern, die Mieten stark zu erhöhen.
Warum ?
Viele Vermieter wollen durch Bauarbeiten in der Wohnung eine höhere Miete bekommen.
Die Vermieter sagen dann zum Mieter: Die Wohnung ist durch die Bauarbeiten besser und moderner.
Also wird auch die Miete höher.
Viele Menschen haben dann Probleme, weil ihre Wohnung immer mehr Miete kostet.
Und sie nicht genug Geld dafür haben.
Was steht im Koalitions-Vertrag zum Thema Internet ?
Viele Menschen machen sich Sorgen um den Schutz von Daten im Internet.
Daten sind zum Beispiel Fotos und E-Mail-Adressen.
Daten können ohne Erlaubnis weitergeben werden.
Viele Menschen fordern deshalb strengere Gesetze für den Schutz von Daten.
In Europa gibt es bald neue Gesetze zum Schutz von Daten.
Die Gesetze gelten dann auch in Deutschland.
CDU, CSU und SPD wollen die Gesetze weiterentwickeln.
Sie nutzen dafür auch die Hilfe von Fachleuten.
Sollen Büchereien sonntags öffnen ?
Büchereien sind Orte für Begegnungen.
Am Sonntag sind Büchereien aber zu.
Muss sich das ändern ?
In Deutschland gibt es viele öffentliche Büchereien.
"Öffentlich" bedeutet: Alle Menschen können in die Bücherei gehen.
Alle können Büchereien zur Bildung nutzen.
Alle bekommen einen Bücherei-Ausweis.
Alle können sich: Bücher, Zeitschriften, CDs oder DVDs ausleihen.
Land-Kreise, Städte oder Gemeinden geben Büchereien dafür Geld.
Die taz spricht mit Kirsten Kappert-Gonther über Büchereien.
Frau Kappert-Gonther ist Psychologin.
Sie beschäftigt sich mit seelischen Erkrankungen.
Sie fragt sich zum Beispiel: Welchen Einfluss haben Büchereien auf seelische Erkrankungen ?
Büchereien auch am Sonntag öffnen
Frau Kappert-Gonther sagt über Büchereien: Büchereien sollen auch am Sonntag öffnen.
Warum ?
Viele Menschen gehen nicht nur wegen der Bücher in die Bücherei.
Frau Kappert-Gonther sagt: Viele Menschen sind einsam.
Sie sind vor allem am Wochenende einsam.
Für viele Menschen ist die Bücherei ein Ort für Begegnungen.
In der Bücherei treffen sie auf ganz unterschiedliche Menschen.
Zum Beispiel auf: • Schüler und Studenten • Senioren • Obdachlose • Flüchtlinge • Familien
Frau Kappert-Gonther findet deshalb: Büchereien sollen auch am Sonntag öffnen.
Büchereien sollen auch am Sonntag ein Ort für Begegnungen sein.
Frau Kappert-Gonther hat etwas ausprobiert.
Sie hat mit einer Bremer Bücherei einen Test gemacht.
Sie haben die Bremer Bücherei auch am Sonntag geöffnet.
Und sie haben verschiedene Orte in der Bücherei eingerichtet:
• ruhige Räume, in denen man alleine sein kann
• Tische für mehrere Leute, an denen man gemeinsam sitzen kann
Es ist still in der Bücherei.
Aber es ist auch laut.
Es ist eine gute Mischung.
Vielen Bücherei-Besuchern hat das gefallen.
Wer arbeitet am Sonntag ?
Ein Problem bei der Idee von Frau Kappert-Gonther ist aber: Bücherei-Mitarbeiter haben am Sonntag frei.
Sie dürfen am Sonntag nicht arbeiten.
Ein Gesetz in Deutschland verbietet das.
Die Frage ist also: Wer arbeitet am Sonntag in der Bücherei ?
Wer räumt die Bücher in die Regale ?
Wer verleiht die Bücher ?
Wer passt auf ?
Die Bücherei kann nur am Sonntag öffnen, wenn die Mitarbeiter sagen: Wir arbeiten freiwillig am Sonntag.
Frau Kappert-Gonther sagt: Einige Mitarbeiter in der Bremer Bücherei haben das gemacht.
Sie haben freiwillig am Sonntag gearbeitet.
Das hat gut geklappt.
Auch andere deutsche Büchereien möchten am Sonntag öffnen.
Aber das Gesetz macht das schwierig.
Frau Kappert-Gonther sucht deshalb nach einer Lösung.
Sie ist nicht nur Psychologin.
Sie ist auch eine Politikerin.
Sie ist Mitglied im Bundestag für die Partei "Die Grünen".
Hier setzt sie sich auch für eine Änderung des Arbeitszeiten-Gesetzes ein.
Sie findet: Das Gesetz soll erlauben, dass Bücherei-Mitarbeiter am Sonntag arbeiten dürfen.
Und dass Büchereien am Sonntag öffnen können.
Wie will Frau Kappert-Gonther das erreichen ?
Sie will zum Beispiel mit den Gewerkschaften über die Arbeits-Zeiten sprechen.
Gewerkschaften setzen sich für die Rechte von Arbeitnehmern ein.
Auch für die Rechte von Bücherei-Mitarbeitern.
Gewerkschaften wollen verhindern, dass Arbeit am Sonntag erlaubt wird.
In Gesprächen will Frau Kappert-Gonther Gewerkschaften, Politiker und weitere Büchereien von ihrer Idee überzeugen.
Sie hofft, dass sie so im Bundestag eine Gesetzes-Änderung erreicht.
Und Büchereien auch am Sonntag ein Ort für Begegnungen sind.
Ist das zu viel Nachspielzeit ?
Bei der Fußball-WM 2018 gibt es oft lange Nachspielzeiten.
Wie gerecht ist das ?
Bei der WM 2018 ist eine Sache sehr auffällig:
Es gibt bei den Fußball-Spielen besonders viel Nachspielzeit.
Die Spiele dauern manchmal bis zu 9 Minuten länger.
Unsere 2 taz-Autoren haben zur Nachspielzeit sehr verschiedene Meinungen.
taz-Autor Jaris Lanzendörfer findet: Nachspielzeit macht das Spiel gerechter !
Und taz-Autorin Doris Akrap findet: Nachspielzeit ist was für Langweiler !
Aber was ist die Nachspielzeit eigentlich ?
Die Regeln dazu lauten so:
Das Fußball-Spiel dauert normalerweise 90 Minuten.
Doch oft werden Fußball-Spiele zwischendurch unterbrochen.
Zum Beispiel:
• wenn sich ein Spieler verletzt
• wenn ein Spieler ausgewechselt wird
In diesen Momenten unterbricht der Schiedsrichter das Spiel.
Es geht also Zeit verloren.
Die Zeit wird am Spiel-Ende nachgeholt.
Das Spiel dauert dann ein paar Minuten länger.
Das nennt man Nachspielzeit.
Der Schiedsrichter entscheidet, wie viel Nachspielzeit es gibt.
taz-Autor Jaris Lanzendörfer findet: Nachspielzeit macht das Spiel gerechter !
Er nennt ein Beispiel:
2 Fußball-Mannschaften spielen gegeneinander.
Wir nennen sie hier Mannschaft A und Mannschaft B.
Das Spiel ist bald zu Ende und Mannschaft A führt gegen Mannschaft B.
Mannschaft A hat also gute Chancen auf den Sieg.
Dann passiert bei Fußball-Spielen oft dasselbe.
Damit Mannschaft A ihre Führung behält, arbeitet sie nun mit einen Trick:
Sie verschwendet absichtlich Zeit.
Das macht Mannschaft A zum Beispiel so:
• Sie spielt langsamer bei Einwürfen, Eckbällen und Abstößen vorm Tor.
• Sie wechselt öfter Spieler aus.
• Oder sie täuscht Verletzungen vor.
Das alles unterbricht das Spiel.
Und das alles verbraucht viel Spielzeit.
Diese Spielzeit fehlt Mannschaft B, um Tore zu schießen und den Rückstand aufzuholen.
Jaris Lanzendörfer findet: Solche Verschwendungen von Spielzeit gibt es bei der WM öfter.
Die verschwendete Zeit muss nachgeholt werden.
Mehr Nachspielzeit ist deshalb gerecht !
Die Mannschaft im Rückstand kann in der Nachspielzeit noch Tore schießen.
Bei der WM gab es in der Nachspielzeit einige wichtige Tore.
Zum Beispiel beim Spiel Deutschland gegen Schweden.
Hier schoss der deutsche Spieler Toni Kroos das entscheidende Tor erst in der 95. Minute.
Hier ist ein Foto von dem Tor:
Oder beim Spiel England gegen Tunesien.
Hier schoss der englische Spieler Harry Kane das entscheidende Tor erst in der 91. Minute.
Hier ist ein Foto von dem Tor:
taz-Autorin Doris Akrap findet: Nachspielzeit ist was für Langweiler !
Sie sagt: Zeit zu verschwenden ist in Ordnung.
Auch im Fußball.
Auch Fußball-Spieler dürfen im Spiel mal trödeln.
Sie dürfen mal durch die Gegend gucken.
Sie dürfen sich mal Zeit für den Einwurf oder Freistoß lassen.
Sie müssen nicht die ganzen 90 Minuten laufen.
Kleine Verschnauf-Pausen sind wichtig, denn Fußball-Spieler sind schließlich keine Roboter.
Kurz gesagt:
Die Nachspielzeit passt nicht zum Fußball.
Denn beim Fußball geht es nicht nur darum jeden Moment von der Spielzeit optimal zu nutzen.
Wer will so eine Fußball-WM sehen ?
So eine Fußball-WM wäre total öde.
Beim Fußball geht es um etwas anderes:
Es geht um Einsatz !
Es geht um Leidenschaft !
Und ja, manchmal klaut eine Mannschaft einer anderen Mannschaft dabei die Zeit.
Aber so ist Fußball eben:
Einer gewinnt, einer verliert.
Und es gibt immer noch den Schiedsrichter.
Er kann einschreiten.
Er kann pfeifen bei langsamen Auswechslungen und vorgetäuschten Verletzungen.
Und er muss schon im Spiel handeln !
Anstatt alles auf die Nachspielzeit zu verschieben.
Gesetz gegen Zucker in Getränken
Zu viel Zucker kann uns krank machen.
Kann eine Zucker-Steuer helfen ?
In vielen Getränken ist viel Zucker, zum Beispiel in Coca-Cola.
Viele Menschen trinken gern Getränke wie Coca-Cola.
Aber was passiert, wenn Menschen zu viel Zucker essen oder trinken ?
Sie können krank werden.
Sie können zum Beispiel Übergewicht bekommen.
Oder sie können die Krankheit Diabetes bekommen.
Die Regierung im Land Großbritannien will verhindern, dass Menschen durch Zucker krank werden.
Deshalb hat sie ein Gesetz gemacht.
Das Gesetz bestimmt, dass es eine Zucker-Steuer für Getränke geben soll.
Das bedeutet: Getränke mit viel Zucker sind jetzt teurer.
Die Regierung in Großbritannien hofft: Wenn diese Getränke teurer sind, kaufen sich die Menschen weniger von diesen Getränken.
Oder Getränke-Hersteller wie Coca-Cola verwenden weniger Zucker bei der Herstellung der Getränke.
Wie ist das in Deutschland geregelt ?
In Deutschland gibt es keine Zucker-Steuer.
Aber warum nicht ?
Die Regierung in Deutschland sagt: Getränke-Hersteller sollen freiwillig weniger Zucker verwenden.
Auch Coca-Cola soll freiwillig weniger Zucker verwenden.
Es soll kein Gesetz dafür geben.
Aber auch in Deutschland essen und trinken die Menschen zu viel Zucker.
Auch hier werden Menschen dadurch krank.
Ein Gesetz kann das vielleicht ändern.
Es gibt aber auch andere Möglichkeiten.
Die Regierung kann auch für bessere Informationen sorgen.
Sie kann dafür sorgen, dass die Menschen genau wissen: • Wie viel Zucker ist in Getränken wie Coca-Cola ? • Wie viel Zucker darf man am Tag essen oder trinken ? • Was ist gesunde Ernährung ? • Was sind die Folgen von ungesunder Ernährung ?
Denn die meisten Menschen kennen nicht die richtigen Antworten auf diese Fragen.
Gibt es eine andere Wahl als Zucker in Getränken ?
Getränke können auch ohne Zucker süß schmecken.
Aber wie geht das ?
Getränke-Firmen können auch Süß-Stoffe verwenden.
Coca-Cola zum Beispiel verwendet auch Süß-Stoffe für Getränke.
Süß-Stoffe schmecken oft sogar süßer als Zucker.
Aber auch Süß-Stoffe können schädlich sein.
Denn Süß-Stoffe täuschen dem Körper etwas vor.
Durch die Süß-Stoffe glaubt der Körper: Jetzt gibt es etwas Süßes mit vielen Kalorien.
Zucker hat viele Kalorien.
Aber Süß-Stoffe haben fast keine Kalorien.
Wenn der Körper nur noch Getränke mit Süß-Stoff bekommt, will der Körper die Kalorien von woanders.
Der Körper will dann zum Beispiel Süßigkeiten.
Und zu viele Süßigkeiten sind ungesund.
Deshalb sollte man süße Nahrungsmittel und süße Getränke nicht zu oft und nicht zu viel essen und trinken.
Dabei ist es egal, ob bei diesen Nahrungsmitteln und Getränken Zucker oder Süß-Stoffe verwendet wurde.
Medien-Berichte über Minderheiten
Die Medien verwenden zu oft Vorurteile, wenn sie über Menschen mit Behinderungen und Menschen mit Migrations-Hintergrund berichten.
Medien wie Zeitungen, Radio und Fernsehen haben ein Problem:
Sie verwenden in ihren Berichten zu oft Vorurteile, wenn sie über Minderheiten berichten.
Vorurteile stehen zum Beispiel oft in Berichten über: • Menschen mit Behinderungen • Menschen mit Migrations-Hintergrund
Das sind Menschen, die selbst aus einem anderen Land kommen.
Oder ihre Eltern oder Großeltern kommen aus einem anderen Land.
Wie berichten die Medien über Menschen mit Behinderungen ?
Die Medien berichten oft mitleidig und zu bewundernd über Menschen mit Behinderungen.
Sie schreiben zum Beispiel: • Menschen schaffen etwas "trotz" ihrer Behinderung. • Sie arbeiten "trotz" ihrer Behinderung. • Sie sind verheiratet "trotz" ihrer Behinderung. • Sie machen Sport "trotz" ihrer Behinderung.
Hier stehen nicht die Menschen selbst im Mittelpunkt, sondern nur ihre Behinderung.
So kann schnell der Eindruck entstehen: Alle Menschen mit Behinderungen leiden.
Für sie ist ihre Behinderung eine Einschränkung oder ein Problem.
Aber das stimmt nicht.
Wie berichten die Medien über Menschen mit Migrations-Hintergrund ?
Die Medien berichten oft einseitig über Menschen mit Migrations-Hintergrund.
Sie berichten öfter über schlechte Dinge als über gute Dinge.
Zum Beispiel berichten die Medien viel über Straftaten von Menschen mit Migrations-Hintergrund.
Dabei wird betont, dass der Täter einen Migrations-Hintergrund hat.
Auch hier stehen nicht die Menschen selbst im Mittelpunkt, sondern nur ihr Migrations-Hintergrund.
So kann schnell der Eindruck entstehen: Alle Menschen mit Migrations-Hintergrund sind kriminell.
Aber das stimmt nicht.
Menschen sind mehr als nur eine Eigenschaft
Bei den Berichten steht oft nur eine Eigenschaft im Vordergrund, nämlich die Behinderung oder der Migrations-Hintergrund.
Diese Darstellung ist zu einseitig.
Warum ?
In Deutschland leben 7,5 Millionen Menschen mit Behinderungen und 19 Millionen Menschen mit Migrations-Hintergrund.
Jeder dieser Menschen geht mit seiner Behinderung oder mit seinem Migrations-Hintergrund anders um.
Jeder von ihnen führt ein anderes Leben.
Sie haben viele verschiedene Eigenschaften, zum Beispiel: • verschiedene Berufe • verschiedene Interessen • verschiedene Erfahrungen • verschiedene Familien und Freunde
Menschen mit Behinderungen und Migrations-Hintergrund dürfen deshalb nicht auf eine Eigenschaft beschränkt werden.
Wieso berichten Medien oft mit Vorurteilen ?
Bei den Medien arbeiten viele Journalisten.
Journalisten spricht man so aus:
Dschur-na-lis-ten.
Viele Journalisten in Deutschland haben keine Behinderung und keinen Migrations-Hintergrund.
Deshalb kennen sie sich damit oft nicht gut aus.
Sie wissen oft nicht: • Wie wollen Menschen mit Behinderungen dargestellt werden ? • Und wie Menschen mit Migrations-Hintergrund ?
Das muss sich ändern.
Bei den Medien müssen ganz unterschiedliche Journalisten arbeiten.
Wie sollten Medien berichten ?
Die Berichte von Medien müssen vielfältiger werden.
Medien können über Gutes berichten.
Sie können über Schlechtes berichten.
Sie können über den Alltag von Menschen berichten.
Sie können über viele verschiedene Themen berichten:
Berufe, Interessen, sportliche und künstlerische Leistungen.
Dabei müssen Behinderung und Migrations-Hintergrund nicht immer im Mittelpunkt stehen.
Es sollte einen guten Ausgleich bei der Bericht-Erstattung geben.
Wir sprechen über Europa !
Im April 2019 findet das "taz lab" statt.
Das "taz lab" ist eine große Veranstaltung mit spannenden Gesprächen und Vorträgen.
Diesmal geht es um das Thema Europa.
Die Zeitung "taz" macht einmal im Jahr das "taz lab".
Das "taz lab" ist eine große Veranstaltung.
Zu der Veranstaltung kommen viele Menschen.
Zum Beispiel Politiker, Journalisten und Fachleute.
Sie sprechen über aktuelle und wichtige Themen.
Das Thema in diesem Jahr lautet Europa.
Denn im Mai gibt es in Europa wichtige Wahlen.
Es gibt Wahlen in der ganzen Europäischen Union, kurz EU.
EU-Bürger aller EU-Länder können dabei ihre Stimme abgeben.
Man nennt diese Wahlen Europa-Wahlen.
Wer wird bei den Europa-Wahlen gewählt ?
Die EU-Bürger wählen die Mitglieder vom Europäischen Parlament.
Das Europäische Parlament hat wichtige Aufgaben in der EU.
Zum Beispiel: • Es prüft und genehmigt Gesetze. • Es prüft und genehmigt die EU-Ausgaben, also wie viel Geld die EU ausgeben darf.
Auf dem "taz lab" sprechen wir viel über Europa-Politik.
Wir wollen dabei gute Antworten finden.
Zum Beispiel auf diese Fragen:
• Welche Politik soll es in Europa geben ?
• Wie sollen die Länder zusammenarbeiten ?
• Wie wollen die Menschen in Europa leben ?
• Wie geht man gemeinsam mit Problemen um ?
Aktuell hat die EU einige Probleme.
Beim "taz lab" sprechen wir auch darüber.
Zum Beispiel über diese 3 Probleme:
1. Rechte Parteien werden in der EU immer stärker.
Immer mehr EU-Bürger wählen rechte Parteien.
Rechte Parteien fordern zum Beispiel eine strenge Flüchtlings-Politik.
Viele rechte Parteien wollen die Länder-Grenzen schließen.
Dann können vielleicht weniger Flüchtlinge nach Europa kommen.
Beim taz lab wird gefragt: Wieso werden rechte Parteien stärker ?
Was kann man dagegen tun ?
Wie verhindert man geschlossene Grenzen ?
Wie bleibt Europa offen ?
2. Großbritannien ist seit 46 Jahren EU-Mitglied.
Nun will das Land aus der EU austreten.
Aktuell verhandelt die EU mit Großbritannien über den Austritt.
Beim taz lab wird gefragt: Warum verlässt Großbritannien die EU ?
Wollen bald noch mehr Länder die EU verlassen ?
3. Die EU-Länder halten oft nicht zusammen.
Zum Beispiel in den Jahren 2015 und 2016.
Damals kamen viele Flüchtlinge in die EU.
Einige EU-Länder haben Flüchtlinge aufgenommen.
Andere EU-Länder haben das nicht gemacht.
Beim taz lab wird gefragt: Warum halten die EU-Länder nicht zusammen ?
Wie kann man das ändern ?
Wie arbeitet man in Krisen besser zusammen ?
All diese Probleme machen klar: Die EU ist nicht perfekt.
Und vielleicht wird die EU nie perfekt sein.
Aber die Mitglieder der EU setzen sich immer noch für wichtige Ideen ein:
• Frieden in Europa
• Zusammenarbeit der Länder
• offene Grenzen
• eine gleichberechtigte Gesellschaft
• alle EU-Bürger können arbeiten und leben, wo sie möchten
Die EU bedeutet Sicherheit für viele Menschen, auch für Menschen außerhalb der EU.
Andere Länder wollen Teil der EU werden.
Viele Menschen suchen Zuflucht in der EU.
Beim "taz lab" sprechen wir deshalb darüber, wie man diese Ideen noch besser umsetzen kann.
Sie haben Meinungen oder Ideen zum Thema Europa ?
Oder wollen Sie sich informieren ?
Kommen Sie zum "taz lab" !

Deutschland gewinnt gegen Schweden
Die deutsche Mannschaft scheidet noch nicht bei der WM aus.
Sie gewinnt das Spiel gegen Schweden.
Die deutsche Mannschaft ist erleichtert.
Sie muss noch nicht aus der WM ausscheiden.
► Wie geht das Spiel aus ?
Schweden schießt 1 Tor.
Deutschland schießt 2 Tore.
Deutschland gewinnt.
► Was passiert im Spiel ?
Deutschland hat das letzte Spiel gegen Mexiko verloren.
Die deutsche Mannschaft will deshalb unbedingt gegen Schweden gewinnen.
Sie rennt sofort vor das schwedische Tor.
In den ersten 10 Spiel-Minuten gibt es mehrere Tor-Chancen für Deutschland.
Aber die deutsche Mannschaft macht dieselben Fehler wie im Spiel gegen Mexiko.
Sie macht oft Fehler im Mittel-Feld und Fehler in der Abwehr.
Die schwedische Mannschaft macht deshalb das erste Tor.
Ihr Tor fällt in der 32. Minute vom Spiel.
Wie reagiert die deutsche Mannschaft auf das Tor von Schweden ?
Jogi Löw ist sauer.
Er ist der deutsche Trainer.
Nach dem Tor von Schweden schaut Jogi Löw als möchte er was kaputt machen, um seine Wut rauszulassen.
Hier ist ein Bild vom wütenden Jogi Löw:
Nach einer Pause beginnt die zweite Halb-Zeit.
Schweden liegt immer noch mit einem Tor vorne.
Doch dann verändert sich das Spiel.
Die schwedische Mannschaft spielt weiterhin gut.
Doch auch die deutsche Mannschaft will weiterhin gewinnen.
Die deutschen Spieler rennen wieder vor das schwedische Tor.
Auch der deutsche Stürmer Marco Reus rennt vor das schwedische Tor.
Und er triff in der 48. Minute vom Spiel.
Er macht ein Tor für die deutsche Mannschaft.
Hier ein Bild vom Tor von Marco Reus:
Nach dem Tor passiert lange nichts wichtiges.
Erst gegen Spiel-Ende passiert wieder etwas.
In der 82. Minute muss ein deutscher Spieler das Fußball-Feld verlassen.
Der Spieler heißt Jérôme Boateng.
Warum muss er den Platz verlassen ?
Er hat einen schwedischen Spieler am Spiel behindert und verletzt.
Hier ist ein Foto von diesem Moment:
Deutschland muss mit 10 Spielern zuende spielen.
Die deutsche Mannschaft hat also einen Spieler weniger als die schwedische Mannschaft.
Trotzdem hat die deutsche Mannschaft am Spiel-Ende eine Tor-Chance.
Der deutsche Spieler Toni Kroos schießt auf das schwedische Tor.
Und er trifft.
Die deutsche Mannschaft gewinnt das Spiel gegen Schweden.
► Was bedeutet der Sieg für die deutsche Mannschaft ?
Der Sieg bedeutet erstmal noch gar nichts.
Deutschland ist noch nicht weiter.
Die deutsche Mannschaft muss erst noch gegen Südkorea spielen.
Bisher ist das Spiel von der deutschen Mannschaft echt schwach.
Die deutsche Mannschaft verliert vielleicht gegen Südkorea.
Dann heißt es: Deutschland ist draußen !
Die deutsche Mannschaft fährt nach Hause !
Werbung für Schwangerschafts-Abbrüche
Eine Ärztin hat im Internet über Schwangerschafts-Abbrüche informiert.
Ein Gericht hat sie dafür verurteilt.
Im deutschen Straf-Gesetz gibt es den Paragrafen 219a.
In diesem Paragrafen steht: Ärzte dürfen keine Werbung machen für Schwangerschafts-Abbrüche.
Und Ärzte dürfen nicht öffentlich sagen, dass sie Schwangerschafts-Abbrüche anbieten.
Mit diesem Gesetz soll verhindert werden, dass Schwangerschafts-Abbrüche in unserer Gesellschaft als normal gelten.
In Deutschland darf eine Frau ihre Schwangerschaft bis zur 12. Schwangerschafts-Woche abbrechen.
Vor dem Abbruch muss die Frau zu einer Beratung gehen.
Nach der Beratung muss die Frau 3 Tage lang über den Schwangerschafts-Abbruch nachdenken.
Erst dann darf die Frau die Schwangerschaft abbrechen.
Es gibt zum Beispiel diese Gründe für einen Schwangerschafts-Abbruch:
● Die Frau fühlt sich nicht bereit für ein Kind.
● Die Frau ist in einer schlechten finanziellen Situation.
● Die Frau wurde vergewaltigt und ist dabei schwanger geworden.
● Die Gesundheit der Frau ist durch die Schwangerschaft gefährdet.
Aber oft fehlen den betroffenen Frauen Informationen wie: Welcher Arzt macht Schwangerschafts-Abbrüche ?
Welche Arten von Schwangerschafts-Abbrüchen gibt es ?
Der Fall Kristina Hänel
Eine Ärztin hat im Jahr 2017 auf ihrer Internet-Seite Informationen zu Schwangerschafts-Abbrüchen veröffentlicht.
Dabei hat die Ärztin auch erklärt, dass sie Schwangerschafts-Abbrüche macht.
Ein Gericht hat die Ärztin dafür verurteilt.
Sie soll jetzt eine Geldstrafe von 6000 Euro zahlen.
Die Ärztin heißt Kristina Hänel.
Die Zeitung taz hat über den Fall Kristina Hänel berichtet.
Die taz hat sogar eine Titelseite dazu gemacht.
Auf der Titelseite sind Fotos von vielen Ärztinnen und Ärzten.
Sie alle stehen auf der Seite von Kristina Hänel.
Sie möchten ihre Kollegin unterstützen.
Die Überschrift lautet: Wir machen Schwangerschafts-Abbrüche !
In einem Artikel in der taz sagen die Ärztinnen und Ärzte: Kristina Hänel hat keinen Fehler gemacht.
Sie hat keine Werbung für Schwangerschafts-Abbrüche gemacht.
Sie hat nur Informationen darüber veröffentlicht.
Und diese Informationen sind wichtig für Frauen.
Ein paar Ärztinnen und Ärzte von der taz-Titelseite haben jetzt eine Anzeige bekommen.
Sie müssen vielleicht vor Gericht, weil sie öffentlich gesagt haben: Wir machen Schwangerschafts-Abbrüche.
Aber: Manche von den Ärztinnen und Ärzten haben schon lange keinen Schwangerschafts-Abbruch mehr gemacht.
Einige sind sogar schon in Rente.
Die Ärztinnen und Ärzte haben keine Werbung für Schwangerschafts-Abbrüche gemacht.
Die Ärztinnen und Ärzte wurden aus diesem Grund angezeigt:
Sie unterstützen Kristina Hänel.
Was sagt der Bundestag zum Paragrafen 219a ?
Viele Menschen wollen den Paragrafen 219a abschaffen.
Deshalb beschäftigt sich jetzt auch der Bundestag mit dem Paragrafen 219a.
Was wollen die Parteien im Bundestag ?
Diese Parteien wollen den Paragrafen abschaffen:
● Bündnis 90 / Die Grünen
● Die Linke
● SPD
Die FDP will den Paragrafen ändern.
Diese Parteien wollen den Paragrafen nicht ändern:
● CDU
● CSU
● AfD
Familien-Nachzug für Flüchtlinge
Viele Flüchtlinge wollen ihre Familie nach Deutschland nachholen.
Die deutsche Regierung macht das schwer.
In den letzten 3 Jahren sind viele Flüchtlinge nach Deutschland gekommen.
Viele Flüchtlinge sind vor Krieg und Verfolgung geflohen.
Viele Flüchtlinge sind alleine nach Deutschland geflohen.
Sie wollen nun ihre Familien nach Deutschland holen.
Das nennt man auch: Familien-Nachzug.
Im Jahr 2016 hat die deutsche Regierung aber gesagt: Zu viele Flüchtlinge kommen nach Deutschland.
Deshalb wurde bei einigen Flüchtlingen der Familien-Nachzug gestoppt.
Bei welchen Flüchtlingen wurde Familien-Nachzug gestoppt ?
Viele Flüchtlinge bekommen in Deutschland einen Schutz-Status.
Aber nicht alle Flüchtlinge bekommen denselben Schutz-Status.
Einige Flüchtlinge bekommen einen eingeschränkten Schutz-Status.
Sie dürfen erstmal nur für 1 Jahr in Deutschland bleiben.
Man sagt dazu auch: sub-si-di-är-er Schutz.
Für Flüchtlinge mit so einem Schutz-Status war der Familien-Nachzug gestoppt.
Der Familien-Nachzug war für 2 Jahre gestoppt.
2 Jahre lang konnten diese Flüchtlinge ihre Familien nicht sehen.
Ab August 2018 dürfen diese Flüchtlinge ihre Familien wieder nach Deutschland holen.
Das gilt auch, wenn ihr Schutz-Status eingeschränkt ist.
Bei dem Familien-Nachzug gibt es aber Regeln.
Die deutsche Regierung sagt: Jeden Monat dürfen nur 1000 Familien-Mitglieder von Flüchtlingen nach Deutschland nachkommen.
Die deutschen Behörden wählen aus, wer nachkommen darf.
Flüchtlinge haben bei der Auswahl unterschiedlich gute Chancen.
Welche Flüchtlinge haben gute Chancen, ihre Familie nachzuholen ?
Das sind zum Beispiel: • Flüchtlinge mit einer Arbeit. • Flüchtlinge, die ihre Familie selbst versorgen können • Flüchtlinge, die gut Deutsch sprechen können.
Kritik an der Auswahl
Einige Politiker kritisieren diese Auswahl.
Warum ?
Für viele Flüchtlinge ist es schwer, in ein neues Land zu kommen.
Viele Flüchtlinge müssen erst die Sprache lernen.
Außerdem wird ihre berufliche Ausbildung in Deutschland oft nicht anerkannt.
Dann ist es schwer, schnell eine Arbeit zu finden.
Einige Politiker fordern deshalb: Auch wenn Flüchtlinge keine Arbeit haben, sollen sie ihre Familien nachholen können.
Auch wenn sie nicht genug Geld haben, sollen sie ihre Familien nachholen können.
Welche Familien-Mitglieder dürfen nach Deutschland kommen ?
Nicht alle Familien-Mitglieder von Flüchtlingen dürfen nach Deutschland kommen.
Nur die Kern-Familie von Flüchtlingen darf nach Deutschland kommen.
Zur Kern-Familie gehören: • minderjährige Kinder • Eltern • Ehepartner, wenn die Ehe vor der Flucht geschlossen wurde • Geschwister unter 18 Jahren
Wann dürfen Familien-Mitglieder aus der Kern-Familie nicht nach Deutschland kommen ?
Nicht alle Familien-Mitglieder aus der Kern-Familie dürfen nach Deutschland kommen.
Nicht kommen dürfen: • Flüchtlinge mit Vorstrafen. • Flüchtlinge, die Gefährder sind.
Bei Gefährdern besteht ein Risiko, dass sie eine Straftat in Deutschland begehen.
Sicherheits-Probleme bei Facebook
Facebook sammelt viele Informationen von Nutzern.
Viele Nutzer möchten das nicht länger mitmachen.
Viele Menschen nutzen die Internet-Plattform Facebook.
Sie teilen dort Fotos, Videos und Nachrichten.
Dabei geben sie viele Infos an Facebook weiter.
Deshalb sind bei Facebook viele Infos über die Nutzer gespeichert.
Zum Beispiel:
• wo die Nutzer wohnen
• wo die Nutzer arbeiten
• welche Interessen die Nutzer haben
• welche Freunde die Nutzer haben
Viele Facebook-Nutzer haben dabei ein schlechtes Gefühl.
Denn sie wissen nicht: Was macht Facebook mit den vielen Infos ?
Sind die Infos bei Facebook sicher ?
Bei Facebook gab es jetzt eine große Sicherheits-Lücke.
Was ist passiert ?
Eine Firma hat viele Infos auf Facebook ausspioniert: bei insgesamt über 50 Millionen Nutzern.
Die Firma heißt Cambridge Analytica.
Die Firma hat mit den Facebook-Nutzer-Infos wahrscheinlich viel Geld verdient.
Und sie hat die Nutzer-Infos wahrscheinlich für diesen Zweck benutzt:
Die Firma hat gezielte Wahl-Werbung auf Facebook für Donald Trump und seine Partei gemacht, während des Wahl-Kampfs in den USA.
Folgen für die Nutzer von Facebook
Viele Menschen fragen sich jetzt: Ist das in Ordnung ?
Dürfen Firmen wie Cambridge Analytica mit Nutzer-Infos solche Geschäfte machen ?
Hat die Firma das Wahl-Ergebnis in den USA beeinflusst ?
Und warum schützt Facebook die Nutzer-Infos nicht besser ?
Viele Menschen sind jetzt unzufrieden mit Facebook.
Und einige Firmen wollen mit Facebook jetzt keine Geschäfte mehr machen.
Einige Menschen und Firmen löschen nun sogar ihr Facebook-Profil.
Das Profil ist die persönliche Seite von einer Person oder von einer Firma auf Facebook.
Dort sieht man das Profilbild, Nachrichten und viele andere Infos.
Auch die taz hat sich gefragt: Wie sollen wir mit Facebook umgehen ?
Sollen wir unsere Facebook-Profile löschen ?
Und wenn ja: Worauf müssen wir dabei achten ?
Hier ein paar Ratschläge dazu:
• vor dem Löschen die liebsten Bilder und Termine speichern
• die Freunde vorwarnen, dass man in Zukunft nicht mehr über Facebook erreichbar ist
• Telefonnummern und Email-Adressen mit den Freunden austauschen
• vielleicht weitere Apps löschen, die Facebook gehören und die Nutzer-Infos sammeln, zum Beispiel Instagram oder Whats-App.
taz leicht sagt erstmal "Tschüss ! "
taz leicht gibt es bald nicht mehr regelmäßig.
Ab Oktober gibt es die Texte nur noch zu besonderen Ereignissen.
taz leicht sagt erstmal "Tschüss" !
taz leicht übersetzt bald weniger taz-Texte in Leichte Sprache.
Ab Oktober gibt es die Texte nur noch zu besonderen Ereignissen.
Zum Beispiel zu politischen Wahlen oder Sport-Ereignissen.
Warum gibt es weniger leichte Texte in der taz ?
Die taz hat zu wenig Geld, um das Leichte-Sprache-Projekt weiterzumachen.
Das ist schade.
Aber wir von taz leicht sind auch froh.
Unsere Übersetzungen haben viel Spaß gemacht.
Wir haben über 70 taz-Texte in Leichte Sprache übersetzt.
Durch diese Texte wissen nun mehr Menschen: Leichte Sprache ist wichtig !
Viele Menschen brauchen Leichte Sprache !
Für unsere leichten Texte gab es viel Lob.
Ganz unterschiedliche Leser haben uns geschreiben.
Zum Beispiel diese Leser:
• Leser mit Lernschwierigkeiten
• Verwandte von Lesern mit Lernschwierigkeiten
• Sprachlehrer
• Leser, die in der Flüchtlings-Hilfe arbeiten
• Leser, die gerade Deutsch lernen
• Eltern, die taz leicht ihren Kindern vorlesen
Eine Frau hat uns geschrieben.
Sie schrieb über ihren Mann:
Mein Mann war früher taz-Leser.
Dann hatte er einen Schlag-Anfall.
Das ist eine Gehirn-Erkrankung.
Mein Mann konnte danach nicht mehr gut lesen.
Auch die taz-Texte waren zu schwer zu lesen.
Mit taz leicht wurde das anders.
Mit taz leicht können mein Mann und ich die taz wieder zusammen lesen.
Eine andere Leserin sagte über unsere leichten taz-Texte: "Es ist schön, die gleiche Zeitung zu lesen, die auch alle anderen lesen können."
Das waren tolle Erfahrungen.
Wir wollen deshalb Danke sagen an unsere Unterstützer:
An taz, taz Panter Stiftung und Fürst Donnersmarck Stiftung.
Und an alle Prüfer vom Leichte-Sprache-Büro Capito, die unsere Texte noch besser gemacht haben !
Danke auch an unsere Leser !
Und hoffentlich bis bald.
Wir melden uns auf Twitter und Facebook, wenn es wieder neue taz-leicht-Texte gibt.
Hier geht es zu taz leicht auf Twitter.
Hier geht es zu taz leicht auf Facebook.
Politisch rechte Verlage auf der Buch-Messe
Auch politisch rechte Verlage sind auf der Buch-Messe in Leipzig.
Aber viele Menschen sind dagegen.
Vom 15. bis zum 18. März 2018 findet die Buch-Messe in Leipzig statt.
Was ist eine Buch-Messe ?
Eine Buch-Messe ist eine große Veranstaltung zum Thema Lesen.
Dort werden neue Bücher und Zeitschriften vorgestellt.
Dort gibt es viele Diskussionen und Buch-Lesungen.
Auch politisch rechte Verlage sind auf der Buch-Messe in Leipzig.
Was ist ein Verlag ?
Ein Verlag gibt Bücher und Zeitschriften heraus.
Auch rechte Verlage wollen auf der Buch-Messe ihre neuen Bücher und Zeitschriften vorstellen.
Auch sie wollen Diskussionen und Buch-Lesungen anbieten.
Was planen rechte Verlage für die Buch-Messe in Leipzig ?
Die rechte Zeitschrift " Compact " plant zum Beispiel eine Lesung mit dem Autor Akif Pirinçci.
Pirinçci spricht man so aus:
Pi-rin-tschi.
Wer ist Akif Pirinçci ?
Akif Pirinçci schreibt Bücher und kommt ursprünglich aus der Türkei.
Akif Pirinçci hat gegen Flüchtlinge und Muslime gehetzt.
Dafür wurde er von einem Gericht verurteilt.
Hier ist ein Foto von Akif Pirinçci:
Auch andere Mitarbeiter und Autoren von rechten Verlagen und Zeitschriften hetzen oft gegen Flüchtlinge und Muslime.
Viele Menschen sind dagegen, dass rechte Verlage auf der Buch-Messe hetzen können.
Diese Menschen wollen verbieten, dass rechte Verlage an der Buch-Messe teilnehmen.
Aber die Leitung von der Buch-Messe sagt: Es gibt Meinungs-Freiheit in Deutschland.
Auch rechte Verlage dürfen ihre Meinung sagen.
Das gilt auch auf der Buch-Messe.
Protest von anderen Verlagen
Andere Verlage auf der Buch-Messe sagen nun: Wenn die Leitung von der Buch-Messe in Leipzig nichts macht, dann unternehmen wir selber etwas gegen die rechten Verlage !
Die anderen Verlage haben eine Gruppe gegründet.
Diese Gruppe heißt " Verlage gegen Rechts ".
Die Gruppe bietet auf der Buch-Messe viele Veranstaltungen an.
Zum Beispiel Veranstaltungen zum Thema Rassismus.
Damit zeigt die Gruppe: Wir sind gegen rechte Hetze.
Wir sind gegen rechte Verlage auf der Buch-Messe.
Polizei-Kosten bei Fußball-Spielen
Manche Fußball-Fans sind gewalttätig.
Die Polizei soll das verhindern.
Aber wer soll die Polizei bezahlen ?
Bei Fußball-Spielen kommt es manchmal zu Gewalt.
Zum Beispiel im Fußball-Stadion oder vor dem Stadion.
Warum kommt es zu Gewalt ?
Bei manchen Fans führt die Liebe zur eigenen Mannschaft zu Hass gegen eine andere Mannschaft.
Das gilt vor allem für Fans von Mannschaften in benachbarten Städten.
Ein Beispiel:
Wer Fan vom Hamburger SV ist, ist Gegner vom SV Werder Bremen.
Fußball-Spiele zwischen diesen Mannschaften heißen: Hoch-Risiko-Spiele.
Denn das Gewalt-Risiko ist hier besonders hoch.
Bei einem Hoch-Risiko-Spiel ist viel Polizei im Einsatz.
Die Polizei sorgt bei diesen Spielen für: • Sicherheit im Fußball-Stadion und in der Nähe • Sicherheit vor und nach dem Fußball-Spiel
Aber wenn viel Polizei im Einsatz ist, kostet das auch viel Geld.
Wer bezahlt den Polizei-Einsatz ?
Den Polizei-Einsatz bezahlt das Bundesland, in dem das Fußball-Spiel stattfindet.
Der Polizei-Einsatz wird also mit Steuer-Geld bezahlt.
Jetzt hat ein Gericht in Bremen entschieden: Das Bundesland Bremen muss bei Hoch-Risiko-Spielen nicht allein den Polizei-Einsatz bezahlen.
Aber wer soll den Polizei-Einsatz noch bezahlen ?
Das Gericht in Bremen sagt: Der Veranstalter der Fußball-Spiele soll mitbezahlen.
Der Veranstalter ist die Deutsche Fußball Liga, kurz DFL.
Die DFL ist ein Zusammenschluss aus allen deutschen Vereinen mit Profi-Fußball-Mannschaften.
Das Gericht in Bremen hat entschieden: Die DFL muss bei Hoch-Risiko-Spielen den Polizei-Einsatz mitbezahlen.
Warum kann das Urteil aus Bremen zum Problem werden ?
Das Gerichts-Urteil aus Bremen kann zum Problem werden.
Denn manchmal werden Gerichts-Urteile auf andere Bereiche übertragen.
Das Gerichts-Urteil zu Gewalt bei Fußball-Spielen könnte zum Beispiel auf Demonstrationen übertragen werden.
Auch bei Demonstrationen kommt es zu Gewalt.
Auch hier ist die Polizei im Einsatz.
Auch diese Kosten trägt bisher das zuständige Bundesland.
Wenn das Gerichts-Urteil auch für Demonstrationen gilt, dann heißt das: Auch hier müssen die Veranstalter den Polizei-Einsatz mitbezahlen.
Dann können nur noch reiche Veranstalter eine Demonstration mit Polizei-Einsatz durchführen.
Und das ist nicht gerecht.
Hilfe für Flüchtlinge
Viele Menschen helfen Flüchtlingen.
Die taz stellt einige Helfer aus Sachsen und Brandenburg vor.
Am 1. September 2019 gibt es 2 Landtags-Wahlen.
Eine Landtags-Wahl ist im Bundesland Sachsen.
Und eine Landtags-Wahl ist im Bundesland Brandenburg.
Die Bürger wählen dort Parteien und Politiker.
Die Parteien und Politiker entscheiden dann über die Politik in den 2 Bundesländern.
Die Zeitung taz schreibt über die 2 Landtags-Wahlen.
Deshalb will die taz wissen: Welche Themen sind den Menschen in Sachsen und Brandenburg wichtig ?
Ein wichtiges Thema sind Flüchtlinge.
Vor 4 Jahren kamen viele Flüchtlinge nach Deutschland, auch nach Sachsen und Brandenburg.
Viele Flüchtlinge mussten dort ein neues Leben beginnen.
Sie hatten oft keine Arbeit und keine Wohnung.
Und sie hatten meistens wenig Geld.
Viele Menschen aus Sachsen und Brandenburg wollten den Flüchtlingen deshalb helfen.
Das war nicht immer leicht.
Denn einige Menschen in Sachsen und Brandenburg sind gegen Flüchtlinge in Deutschland.
Die Helfer mussten also gegen viele Vorurteile kämpfen.
Die taz hat mit einigen Helfern gesprochen.
Hier stellen wir 3 von ihnen vor.
Dieter Bollmann
Dieter Bollmann ist 82 Jahre alt.
Er wohnt in Frankfurt ( Oder ) in Brandenburg.
Früher war er Anwalt.
Heute arbeitet er ohne Bezahlung.
Er hilft bei drohenden Abschiebungen.
Also wenn der Staat zu Flüchtlingen sagt: Sie müssen Deutschland jetzt verlassen.
Sie haben hier kein Aufenthalts-Recht.
Sie müssen zurück in ihr Heimat-Land.
Wie kam Dieter Bollmann zu dieser Arbeit ?
Er wurde vor 4 Jahren gefragt: Herr Bollmann, Sie sind doch Anwalt ?
Können Sie 2 Brüdern helfen ?
Sie kommen aus dem afrikanischen Land Kamerun.
Der deutsche Staat sagt: Die 2 Brüder sollen Deutschland verlassen.
Sie sollen zurück nach Kamerun.
Dieter Bollmann hat geholfen.
Und er hatte Erfolg.
Die 2 Brüder leben noch in Deutschland.
Sie haben eine Ausbildung gemacht.
Und ein Bruder hat eine Familie gegründet.
Mittlerweile hat Dieter Bollmann viele Abschiebungen verhindert.
Yvonne Trenner
Yvonne Trenner wohnt in Oranienburg in Brandenburg.
Seit 5 Jahren hilft sie Flüchtlingen.
Zuerst hat sie Flüchtlinge zu Ärzten oder Vermietern begleitet.
Und sie hat Deutsch unterrichtet.
Heute hilft sie Flüchtlingen bei der Arbeits-Suche.
Dafür hat sie sogar ein eigenes Büro eröffnet.
Yvonne Trenner vermittelt 50 bis 60 Flüchtlinge pro Jahr in eine Ausbildungen oder in ein Praktikum.
Und sie hilft beim Bewerben.
Manchmal dauert die Arbeits-Suche lange.
Das sorgt für viel Frust.
Aber oft klappt es und das ist gut.
Für Flüchtlinge ist Arbeit wichtig für einen Neu-Beginn.
Yvonne Trenner sagt dazu: Nur so können Flüchtlinge ein Leben in Deutschland aufbauen.
Sie verdienen bei der Arbeit eigenes Geld.
Und sie lernen die deutsche Sprache schneller.
Außerdem lernen sie bei der Arbeit andere Menschen kennen.
Denn Deutsche und Flüchtlinge arbeiten zusammen.
Das hilft gegen Berührungs-Ängste und Vorurteile.
Franziska Meißner
Franziska Meißner wohnt in Leipzig in Sachsen.
Sie ist Schwimm-Lehrerin und leitet seit 4 Jahren ein Schwimm-Projekt.
Dabei bringt sie auch Flüchtlingen das Schwimmen bei.
Einige Schwimm-Schüler sind 12 Jahre alt.
Und einige sind fast 50 Jahr alt.
Das Schwimmen bringt Menschen zusammen.
Im Schwimm-Unterricht wird auch Deutsch geübt.
Franziska Meißner hofft: Das Schwimm-Projekt hilft den Menschen beim Neu-Beginn in Deutschland.
Am Anfang hat Franziska Meißner gedacht: Vielleicht wird das Schwimm-Projekt schwierig.
Vielleicht wird sie als Frau nicht respektiert.
Denn in einigen Kulturen ist es nicht üblich, dass Frauen auch Männer unterrichten.
Deshalb hat Franziska Meißner zuerst gemeinsam mit einem männlichen Schwimm-Lehrer unterrichtet.
Doch ihre Sorgen waren unnötig.
Alles hat gut geklappt.
Heute unterrichtet Franziska Meißner alleine.
Ihre Kurse sind beliebt.
Es werden immer mehr Kurse.
Und sie sind alle ausgebucht.
Mehr Inklusion für den RBB
Der RBB-Rundfunk-Rat soll alle Menschen in Berlin und Brandenburg vertreten.
Aber kein Mitglied im RBB-Rundfunk-Rat hat selbst eine Behinderung.
Christian Specht ist im Vorstand von der Lebenshilfe in Berlin.
Die Lebenshilfe unterstützt Menschen mit Behinderungen.
Christian Specht hat selbst eine Behinderung.
Und er findet: Im Programm vom Sender RBB kommen zu wenige Menschen mit Behinderungen vor.
Und der RBB tut noch zu wenig für Barriere-Freiheit.
Christian Specht fordert: Das muss sich ändern.
Menschen mit Behinderungen müssen im Programm vorkommen.
Menschen mit Behinderungen sollen beim RBB mitreden.
Was ist der RBB ?
RBB ist die Abkürzung für: Rundfunk Berlin Brandenburg.
Der RBB sendet Programme im Fernsehen und im Radio.
Der RBB gehört zu einem Verbund von mehreren regionalen Sendern in Deutschland.
Dieser Verbund heißt: ARD.
Zur ARD gehören zum Beispiel: • der Nord-Deutsche Rundfunk im Norden von Deutschland, • der Bayerische Rundfunk in Bayern, • und auch der RBB in Berlin und Brandenburg gehört dazu.
Alle diese Sender sind öffentlich-rechtlich.
Das bedeutet: Alle Bürger in Deutschland zahlen Geld für diese Sender.
Dafür müssen diese Sender einen Auftrag erfüllen.
Der Auftrag steht in einem Vertrag, dem Rundfunk-Staats-Vertrag.
In dem Vertrag steht zum Beispiel: Das Programm vom RBB muss verschiedene Meinungen aus der Gesellschaft abbilden.
Das Programm muss die Wünsche von Menschen mit Behinderungen berücksichtigen.
Wer überwacht die Einhaltung des Auftrags ?
Der RBB-Rundfunk-Rat überwacht die Einhaltung des Auftrags.
Er überwacht das bereits gesendete Programm.
Der RBB-Rundfunk-Rat hat 30 Mitglieder.
Die Mitglieder vertreten verschiedene gesellschaftliche Gruppen.
Sie kommen zum Beispiel: • aus der Politik • aus der katholischen und evangelischen Kirche • aus jüdischen Gemeinden • aus dem deutschen Gewerkschafts-Bund, der sich für die Rechte von Arbeitnehmern einsetzt • aus dem Sport-Verbund • aus dem Frauen-Rat
Aber viele gesellschaftliche Gruppen sind nicht dabei.
Zum Beispiel Muslime, Schwule und Lesben.
Außerdem ist kein Mensch mit Behinderung im RBB-Rundfunk-Rat.
Wie machen es andere Sender ?
Bei anderen öffentlich-rechtlichen Sendern ist es anders.
Zum Beispiel beim Sender BR.
BR ist kurz für: Bayerischer Rundfunk.
Auch der BR hat einen Rundfunk-Rat mit 50 Mitgliedern.
Und die Mitglieder kommen auch aus ganz verschiedenen Gruppen.
Hier gibt es aber einen Vertreter für Menschen mit Behinderungen.
Wenn der BR für mehr Vielfalt sorgen kann, dann kann der RBB das auch.
Der BR kann ein Vorbild für den RBB sein.
Der RBB kann auch Menschen mit Behinderungen beteiligen.
Dafür gibt es bald eine gute Chance.
Im Februar 2019 wird der RBB-Rundfunk-Rat neu gebildet.
Christian Specht fordert deshalb: Der Rundfunk-Rat muss endlich ein Zeichen für Inklusion setzen.
Menschen mit Behinderung müssen ab Februar Mitglied werden im neuen Rundfunk-Rat.
Sonst werden die Meinungen von Menschen mit Behinderungen nicht ausreichend vertreten.
Christian Specht ist mit seiner Forderung schon weit gekommen.
Er und seine Unterstützer haben viel erreicht.
Im Vertrag von der Berliner Regierung steht bereits: Die Berliner Regierung will die Zusammensetzung vom RBB-Rundfunk-Rat verbessern.
Sie will mehr Vielfalt im RBB-Rundfunk-Rat.
Wer unterstützt Christian Specht ?
Die Berliner Lebenshilfe und der Berliner Behinderten-Verband unterstützen Christian Specht.
Sie geben Christian Specht recht und sagen: Menschen mit Behinderung fühlen sich nicht durch den RBB-Rundfunk-Rat vertreten.
Das muss sich ändern.
Zum Beispiel haben sie diese Idee:
Die Mitglieder im RBB-Rundfunk-Rat wechseln sich ab.
Erst arbeitet ein Kirchen-Vertreter mit.
Danach arbeitet ein Behinderten-Vertreter mit.
Wer sieht Christian Spechts Forderung kritisch ?
Einige Politiker sehen die Forderung kritisch.
Die SPD-Politikerin Karin Halsch sagt: Die Interessen von Menschen mit Behinderungen werden im RBB-Rundfunk-Rat bereits berücksichtigt.
Denn andere Vertreter denken die Interessen von Menschen mit Behinderungen mit.
Der CDU-Politiker Christian Goiny sagt: Zum Beispiel denken Vertreter aus der Politik die Interessen von Menschen mit Behinderungen mit.
Der Grünen-Politiker Andreas Otto sagt: Die Forderung nach einem Behinderten-Vertreter führt zu weiteren Forderungen.
Das kann zum Problem werden:
Dann wollen weitere Gruppen im Rundfunk-Rat sitzen.
Dann hat der Rundfunk-Rat zu viele Mitglieder.
Dann kann der Rundfunk-Rat vielleicht nicht mehr richtig arbeiten.
Sicher ist: Christian Specht wird nicht aufgeben.
Er ist hartnäckig.
Er fragt und fordert weiter, bis Menschen mit Behinderungen im RBB-Rundfunk-Rat vertreten sind.

Die WM im Überblick
Wie laufen die Spiel-Runden ab ?
Was ist neu bei dieser WM ?
Welche Mannschaft hat Chancen auf den Pokal ?
Die WM 2018 beginnt.
32 Mannschaften sind in Russland dabei.
64 Fußball-Spiele wird es geben.
Und die wichtigen Fragen lauten erstmal: Wie laufen die Spiel-Runden ab ?
Was ist neu bei dieser WM ?
Welche Mannschaften haben Chancen auf den Pokal ?
Welche Mannschaft überrascht vielleicht ?
Welcher Spieler überrascht vielleicht ?
Wie laufen die Spiel-Runden ab ?
Bei der WM gibt es mehrere Spiel-Runden.
• Die Vorrunde
• Und die K.O.-Runden
In der Vorrunde gibt es 48 Spiele.
Die Mannschaften werden in 8 Gruppen aufgeteilt.
In jeder Gruppe sind 4 Mannschaften.
Die deutsche Mannschaft ist zum Beispiel in einer Gruppe mit: Mexiko, Schweden und Südkorea.
Alle Mannschaften in den Gruppen spielen gegeneinander.
Die besten 2 Mannschaften aus jeder Gruppe kommen dann weiter.
Sie kommen weiter in die K.O.-Runden.
In den K.O.-Runden gibt es 16 Spiele.
Wofür steht K.O. ?
K.O. ist eine Abkürzung für: knock-out.
Das ist Englisch und heißt: außer Gefecht.
Denn nach jedem K.O.-Spiel kommt nur eine Mannschaft weiter.
Nur die Gewinner-Mannschaft kommt weiter in die nächste Runde.
Die Verlierer-Mannschaft scheidet aus.
Das geht auf diese Weise immer so weiter bis zum WM-Finale.
Bis dann am Ende der WM-Gewinner feststeht.
Das Problem ist: Nicht immer steht am Spiel-Ende ein eindeutiger Gewinner fest.
Manchmal haben die Mannschaften gleich viele Tore.
Was passiert dann ?
Dann gibt es eine Verlängerung.
Und dann vielleicht noch ein Elf-Meter-Schießen.
Bis es am Ende ein eindeutiges Ergebnis gibt.
Was ist neu an dieser WM ?
Bei dieser WM gibt es zum ersten Mal den Video-Beweis.
Was ist der Video-Beweis ?
Oft kommt es bei Fußball-Spielen zu schwierigen Situationen.
Dann ist nicht ganz sicher: War der Spieler im Abseits ?
Hat der Spieler die Hand benutzt ?
Dann entscheidet der Schiedsrichter, was passiert ist und welche Folgen das hat.
Doch nicht immer hat der Schiedsrichter alles im Blick.
Der Video-Beweis soll Fehl-Entscheidungen verhindern.
Dafür hat der Schiedsrichter mehrere Helfer.
Die Helfer schauen sich die schwierige Situation im Video noch mal an.
Und sie sagen dem Schiedsrichter dann, wie er entscheiden soll.
Am Video-Beweis gibt es viel Kritik
Zum Beispiel diese 2 Kritik-Punkte.
Erste Kritik:
Das Spiel wird oft für den Video-Beweis unterbrochen.
Einige Minuten geht das Spiel dann nicht weiter.
In dieser Zeit wird das Video ausgewertet und eine Entscheidung getroffen.
Das stört den Spiel-Fluss.
Bei der WM sind deshalb mehr Helfer als sonst für den Video-Beweis zuständig.
So soll die Entscheidung schneller gefällt werden.
Zweite Kritik:
Die Zuschauer im Stadion bekommen oft zu wenige Infos.
Sie wissen oft nicht: Was zeigt der Video-Beweis ?
Welche neuen Infos hat der Schiedsrichter ?
Was sagen ihm seine Helfer ?
Bei der WM werden deshalb Infos auf Stadion-Bildschirmen eingeblendet.
Die Zuschauer sehen auf den Bildschirmen: 1. Eine Video-Wiederholung von entscheidenden Szenen.
2. Welche Infos der Schiedsrichter gerade bekommt.
Welche Mannschaft hat Chancen auf den Pokal ?
Frankreich könnte diesmal den Pokal gewinnen.
Das Land hat eine starke Mannschaft.
Mit vielen jungen, begabten Angreifern.
Auch Spanien und Brasilien haben gute Chancen.
Und auch Deutschland könnte wieder Weltmeister werden.
Obwohl die letzten deutschen Spiele vor der WM nicht gut waren.
Aber die deutsche Mannschaft ist dafür bekannt, dass sie erst im Wettbewerb richtig loslegt.
Welche Mannschaft überrascht vielleicht ?
Viele Fans glauben: Belgien könnte bei der WM überraschen.
Das Land könnte vielleicht gewinnen.
Denn die Mannschaft hat starke Einzelspieler.
Viele Fans haben schon bei früheren Turnieren an Belgien geglaubt.
Bisher hat es die belgische Mannschaft aber nie weit geschafft.
Welcher Spieler überrascht vielleicht ?
Mohamed Salah ist Stürmer in der ägyptischen Mannschaft.
Er hat zuletzt in der englischen Liga sehr stark gespielt.
Er spielt dort beim Verein FC Liverpool.
Mohamed Salah wurde mehrfach geehrt:
Er ist Spieler der Saison in England und Fußballer des Jahres.
Das hatte ihm niemand zugetraut.
Seine ägyptische Mannschaft ist nicht so stark.
Aber Salah will jetzt auch mit Ägypten bei der WM überraschen.
Hier ist ein Foto von ihm:
Warum rennt Neuer aus dem Tor ?
Christian Specht ärgert sich über das WM-Spiel der deutschen Mannschaft.
Vor allem über Torwart Manuel Neuer.
Das Bild zeigt Manuel Neuer.
Den Torwart der deutschen Mannschaft.
Sein Verhalten ärgert mich.
Er ist beim Spiel gegen Südkorea einfach aus dem Tor gerannt.
Die südkoreanische Mannschaft hat dann ein Tor gemacht.
Das Spiel war sowieso ein Reinfall.
Aber Neuer hat es total versaut.
Das geht nicht.
Ein Torwart darf nicht einfach aus dem Tor abhauen.
Was, wenn das alle machen ?
Wenn alle einfach so mit ihrem Job aufhören ?
Wenn die hier in der taz einfach aufhören, eine Zeitung zu machen ?
Ich kann es immer noch nicht glauben: Neuer hat einfach das Tor verlassen !
Wahl zur Behinderten-Vertretung
Viele Firmen haben eine Schwer-Behinderten-Vertretung.
Diese Vertretung wird aktuell neu gewählt, zum Beispiel in der Stadt Bremen.
Viele Firmen haben eine Schwer-Behinderten-Vertretung.
Diese Vertretung besteht aus einer oder mehreren Personen.
Was machen diese Personen in der Firma ?
Sie unterstützen schwer-behinderte Mitarbeiter.
Sie vertreten die Interessen von schwer-behinderten Mitarbeitern.
Die Schwer-Behinderten-Vertreter werden alle 4 Jahre neu gewählt.
Aktuell finden die Neu-Wahlen statt.
Haben alle Firmen eine Schwer-Behinderten-Vertretung ?
Die Schwer-Behinderten-Vertretung haben nur Firmen mit 5 oder mehr schwer-behinderten Mitarbeitern.
Was bedeutet "Schwer-Behinderung" ?
Das Wort kommt aus dem Sozial-Gesetz-Buch.
Danach sind Behinderungen verschieden schwer.
Eine leichte Behinderung ist zum Beispiel, wenn man eine Gehhilfe braucht.
Eine sehr schwere Behinderung ist zum Beispiel, wenn man dauerhaft im Rollstuhl sitzt.
Das Versorgungs-Amt kümmert sich um die Angelegenheiten von Menschen mit einer Schwer-Behinderung.
Das Amt bestimmt auch den Schwere-Grad einer Behinderung.
Wie bestimmt das Amt den Schwere-Grad ?
Es benutzt dazu die Zahlen-Werte 20 bis 100.
Der Zahlen-Wert 20 bedeutet: Die Person hat eine leichte Behinderung.
Der Zahlen-Wert 100 bedeutet: Die Person hat eine sehr schwere Behinderung.
Ab einem Zahlen-Wert von 50 gilt ein Mensch als schwer-behindert.
Außerdem gilt: Ab einem Zahlen-Wert von 30 gibt es eine Gleichstellung zur Schwer-Behinderung.
Das bedeutet: Gleichgestellte Menschen haben ähnliche Rechte wie schwer-behinderte Menschen.
Welche Rechte gibt es ?
Im Sozial-Gesetz-Buch steht: Schwer-behinderte und gleichgestellte Menschen können am Arbeitsplatz ähnliche Dinge fordern.
Dazu gehören zum Beispiel diese Dinge:
• ein Arbeitsplatz ohne Hindernisse
• ein besonderer Kündigungs-Schutz
• zusätzlicher Urlaub
• Reha-Maßnahmen
Hier beginnt die Arbeit der Schwer-Behinderten-Vertreter.
Sie unterstützen diese beiden Mitarbeiter-Gruppen bei der Durchsetzung ihrer Rechte am Arbeitsplatz.
Außerdem haben Schwer-Behinderten-Vertreter diese Aufgaben:
• Sie setzen sich für mehr Teilhabe in der Firma ein.
• Sie planen Weiterbildungen.
• Sie sind bei Bewerbungs-Gesprächen dabei.
• Sie beraten bei Verträgen.
• Sie sind Ansprech-Partner und Vertrauens-Person.
Alle Mitarbeiter in einer Firma können Schwer-Behinderten-Vertreter werden.
Und wie gesagt:
Aktuell werden neue Vertreter gewählt.
Noch bis zum 30. November 2018 finden die Wahlen statt.
Die taz hat sich die Wahl in Bremen genauer angeschaut.
Viele Firmen machen bei dieser Wahl mit.
Insgesamt können 1700 schwer-behinderte und gleichgestellte Personen in Bremen ihre Schwer-Behinderten-Vertretung wählen.
Eine dieser Firmen ist der Sender "Radio Bremen".
Hier ist Dagmar Schwärmer die Schwer-Behinderten-Vertreterin.
Sie hat gerade viel zu tun.
Denn sie muss die Wahl planen.
Gleichzeitig muss sie ihre Aufgaben als Vertreterin erfüllen.
Sie sagt über ihre Aufgaben bei "Radio Bremen": Ich mache auf das Thema Inklusion aufmerksam.
Ich frage mich: Wie können wir die Bedingungen verbessern für Menschen mit Behinderungen in unserer Firma ?
Manchmal muss ich dafür immer wieder dieselben Dinge sagen.
Nur so wird Inklusion auch Teil des Alltags in der Firma.
Zum Beispiel muss ich immer wieder sagen: Bewerber sollen nur nach ihren Fähigkeiten beurteilt werden !
Was für Fähigkeiten und Ziele braucht ein Schwer-Behinderten-Vertreter ?
Dagmar Schwärmer sagt: Schwer-Behinderten-Vertreter arbeiten ehrenamtlich, also freiwillig und manchmal ohne Bezahlung.
Trotzdem haben sie viele Aufgaben zu erledigen.
Sie müssen also viel Einsatz zeigen.
Dagmar Schwärmer sagt: Mein Ziel ist zum Beispiel ein Wandel in der Gesellschaft.
Ich will mehr Zusammenhalt und Inklusion.
Damit fange ich bei "Radio Bremen" an.
Demonstrationen am 1. Mai
In vielen Städten in Deutschland haben am 1. Mai Menschen demonstriert.
Sie haben vor allem sichere Arbeits·plätze gefordert.
Auch in Saarbrücken haben sie demonstriert.
6-Tausend 500 Menschen haben sich vor dem Schloss in Saarbrücken getroffen.
Hier ging es vor allem um die Arbeits·plätze in der Industrie.
Im Saarland sind in vielen Firmen Arbeits·plätze in Gefahr.
Automobil·firmen und Stahl·firmen wollen Arbeits·plätze streichen.
Die Gewerkschaften sagen deshalb: • Die Politiker müssen mehr tun, damit keine Arbeits·plätze wegfallen. • Die Firmen und Gewerkschaften müssen mehr darüber reden, wie Arbeits·plätze erhalten bleiben können.
Der 1. Mai ist in vielen Ländern ein Feiertag.
An diesem Tag demonstrieren jedes Jahr Menschen und fordern bessere Arbeits·bedingungen.
Erste Neujahrs·ansprache von Hans
Minister·präsident Tobias Hans hat zum Beginn des neuen Jahres seine erste Neujahrs·ansprache gehalten.
Ein Thema der Ansprache war die Digitalisierung.
Minister·präsident Tobias Hans sagt: Die Digitalisierung ist eine große Chance für das Saarland.
Digitalisierung heißt: In immer mehr Bereichen im öffentlichen Leben werden Computer und das Internet genutzt.
Minister·präsident Tobias Hans sagt: Die Digitalisierung kann beim wirtschaftlichen Wandel im Saarland helfen.
Jedes Jahr hält der Minister·präsident eine Neujahrs·ansprache.
Tobias Hans ist erst im vergangenen Jahr Minister·präsident geworden.
Deshalb war es seine erste Neujahrs·ansprache.
Räuber sprengen Geld·automaten
Mehrere Diebe haben am Montag ( 14. Januar ) und am Donnerstag ( 17. Januar ) in Saarbrücken und in Merzig insgesamt 4 Geld·automaten gesprengt.
Die Polizei sagt: Das war eine Bande, die so etwas schon oft gemacht hat.
Sie kommt aus den Niederlanden oder aus Polen.
Die Räuber arbeiten immer auf die gleiche Weise.
Sie leiten dann Gas in den Automaten und bringen das Gas zur Explosion.
Dann flüchten sie mit dem Geld auf schnellen Motorrollern.
Wie viel Geld die Täter mit·genommen haben, will die Polizei nicht sagen.
Die Diebe sind bisher ent·kommen.
In Merzig haben sie vor dem Raub sogar die Einfahrt der Polizei mit einer Kette zu·geschlossen.
Die Polizisten mussten zuerst die Feuer·wehr rufen.
Sie konnten erst dann zum Tatort fahren.
Die Polizei sucht Zeugen, die Informationen zu den Tätern haben.
Hitze im Saarland
Noch nie war es im Juni so heiß im Saarland.
In Saarbrücken-Burbach war es am Mittwoch ( 26.06. ) 37,3 Grad.
Auch deutschland·weit gibt es einen neuen Rekord·wert für den Juni.
In Brandenburg und in Sachsen waren es 38,6 Grad.
Der höchste Wert hatte bisher bei 38,5 Grad gelegen.
So heiß war es im Juni 1947 im Bundesland Baden-Württemberg.
Die heißen Tage haben Folgen.
Zum Beispiel: • Schulen im Saarland dürfen ihre Schüler früher nach Hause schicken • In Forbach in Frankreich bleiben die Schulen am Freitag ( 28.06. ) zu • Im Kinder·garten in Wallerfangen war es so heiß, dass er schließen musste. • Die Hitze hat an einigen Straßen die Fahr·bahn beschädigt.
Streiks bei Geld·transport·unternehmen
Viele Geld·transporte im Saarland fallen aus.
Bei den Geld·transport·unternehmen wird gestreikt.
Die Gewerkschaft Verdi hat die Mitarbeiter von Geld·transport·unternehmen zum Streik aufgefordert.
Die Gewerkschaft fordert mehr Gehalt für die Mitarbeiter der Geld·transport·unternehmen.
Die Mitarbeiter der Unternehmen transportieren Geld von Geschäften zu Banken.
Sie füllen außerdem Geld·automaten auf.
Dazu müssen die Mitarbeiter und die Autos besonders gesichert sein.
Im Saarland macht das zum Beispiel das Unternehmen Prosegur aus Neunkirchen.
Dort beteiligen sich 30 Mitarbeiter an dem Steik.
VdK eröffnet neues Beratungs·zentrum
Der Sozial·verband VdK Saarland hat am Freitag ( 4. Januar ) sein neues Beratungs·zentrum in Neunkirchen eröffnet.
In dem neuen Beratungszentrum bietet der Verband bedürftigen Menschen viele Hilfs- und Beratungs·angebote.
Das neue Beratungs·zentrum befindet sich mitten in der Stadt und ist damit für jeden gut erreichbar.
Im Gebäude gibt es einen Aufzug sowie eine behinderten·gerechte Toilette.
Hinter dem Gebäude gibt es außerdem einen Behinderten·parkplatz.
In dem Beratungs·zentrum helfen Juristen und ehrenamtliche Berater in den Bereichen • Rente • Behinderung • Gesundheit und • Pflege
Minister·präsident Tobias Hans lobte bei der Eröffnung die Hilfs·angebote des Sozial·verbandes.
Tobias Hans sagte: Sozial schwächere, kranke, alte oder behinderte Menschen dürfen nicht benachteiligt werden.
Hier bekommen Menschen schnell Hilfe.
Narren·empfang in der Staats·kanzlei
Rund 350 Narren waren am Sonntag·vormittag ( 6. Januar ) beim traditionellen Narren·empfang in der Saarbrücker Staats·kanzlei.

Viele junge Menschen verlassen das Saarland
Fast 25-Tausend Menschen sind von 2007 bis 2017 aus dem Saarland weg·gezogen.
Sie leben jetzt in anderen Bundes·ländern.
Vor allem junge Menschen verlassen das Saarland.
Warum gehen vor allem junge Menschen aus dem Saarland weg ?
• Sie fangen zum Beispiel ein Studium in einem anderen Bundes·land an oder • Sie finden eine Arbeits·stelle in einem anderen Bundes·land.
Die Arbeitskammer im Saarland sagt: Im Saarland ist eine gute Universität wichtig.
Auch gut bezahlte Jobs sind wichtig.
Dann bleiben die jungen Menschen im Saarland.
Neue Kurse für Flüchtlinge
Das Anker·Zentrum in Lebach bietet bald neue Kurse für Flüchtlinge an.
Der saarländische Innen·minister Bouillon sagt: Wir wollen die Menschen in Lebach besser betreuen.
In den neuen Kursen können die Flüchtlinge: • Schwimmen lernen • Fahrrad·fahren lernen • sich über Gewalt und Schutz beraten lassen
In Lebach gibt es bereits Kurse für Flüchtlinge.
Zum Beispiel:
• Musik·kurse für Kinder
• Mal·kurse für Kinder
• wie man kaputte Gegenstände repariert
Warum gibt es die Kurse ?
Ziel ist es, den Flüchtlingen bei der Integration zu helfen.
Das heißt, sie sollen sich in Deutschland besser zurecht·finden.
Ehren·amt fördern
Das Ehren·amt im Saarland soll gefördert weren.
Die Gemeinschaft Pro Ehrenamt will dazu eine Seite im Internet einrichten.
Die Gemeinschaft Pro Ehren·amt will das Ehren·amt im Saarland fördern.
Ehren·amt heißt: Menschen arbeiten zum Beispiel freiwillig • im Krankenhaus • in der Kirche • bei Hilfsorganisationen.
Für diese Arbeit bekommen die Menschen aber kein Geld.
Die Gemeinschaft Pro Ehren·amt möchte diese Arbeit besser organisieren.
Deshalb will sie eine Seite im Internet einrichten.
Die Vorbereitungen dafür laufen schon.
Allerdings braucht die Gemeinschaft Pro Ehren·amt dafür noch Geld.
Die Gemeinschaft möchte außerdem, dass das Ehren·amt in die saarländische Verfassung aufgenommen wird.
In der Verfassung stehen die Regeln eines Landes.
Freundschafts·vertrag zwischen Deutschland und Frankreich
Die Länder Deutschland und Frankreich wollen noch enger zusammen·arbeiten.
Das haben sie in einen Vertrag geschrieben.
Vor allem Menschen in den Grenz·regionen sollen sich noch näher kommen.
Wichtige Politiker haben den Vertrag in Aachen unterzeichnet.
Für Deutschland waren es: • Bundes·kanzlerin Merkel und • Bundes·außen·minister Maas.
Für Frankreich haben unterschrieben: • Präsident Macron und • Außen·minister Le Drian.
In dem Vertrag stehen viele Bereiche, in denen die beiden Länder zusammen·arbeiten wollen.
Das sind zum Bespiel: • Die Wirtschaft:
Unternehmen sollen es leichter haben, wenn sie im anderen Land Geschäfte machen.
Sie sollen dafür weniger Formulare ausfüllen oder weniger Genehmigungen brauchen.
• Die Verteidigungs·politik:
Deutschland und Frankreich wollen sich helfen, wenn sie von einem anderen Land angegriffen werden.
Beide Länder wollen sich aber auch ab·sprechen, an welches Land sie Waffen liefern.
• Das Zusammen·leben: Damit sich die Menschen in Deutschland und Frankreich näher kommen, müssen sie die Sprache des anderen Landes können.
Dafür soll es in Deutschland mehr Französisch·unterricht und in Frankreich mehr Deutsch·unterricht geben.
Die Menschen sollen leichter ins andere Land kommen.
Deshalb können Bus- und Bahn·unternehmen einfacher zusammen·arbeiten.
Und auch im Gesundheits·bereich soll es Absprachen geben, zum Beispiel zwischen Kranken·häusern.
Die Landes·regierung im Saarland findet den neuen Vertrag gut.
Minister·präsident Hans sagt: Hier in der Grenz·region ist die Zusammen·arbeit besonders wichtig.
Wirtschafts·ministerin Rehlinger sieht das auch so und fordert: Damit die bessere Zusammen·arbeit auch bezahlt werden kann, muss die Bundes·regierung dafür auch Geld bereit stellen.
Die Freundschaft zu Frankreich ist der Landes·regierung im Saarland sehr wichtig.
Sie hat dafür vor 5 Jahren ein Projekt gestartet:
es heißt Frankreich·strategie.
Ziel ist: Bis zum Jahr 2043 sollen viele Saarländer genauso gut Französisch wie Deutsch sprechen.
Firmen beschäftigen nicht genug Schwer·behinderte
Nur wenige Firmen im Saarland beschäftigen genug Menschen mit einer Schwer·behinderung.
Die anderen Firmen müssen eine Strafe bezahlen.
Sie heißt "Ausgleichs·abgabe".
Immer mehr Firmen im Saarland müssen die Ausgleichs·abgabe bezahlen.
In diesem Jahr sind es mehr als 1-Tausend.
Wie hoch ist die Ausgleichs·abgabe ?
Das hängt zum Beispiel davon ab: • Wie viele Arbeits·plätze hat die Firma ? • Wie viele Menschen mit einer Schwer·behinderung arbeiten in der Firma ?
Was passiert mit der Ausgleichs·abgabe ?
Damit werden zum Beispiel neue Jobs für Menschen mit einer Schwer·behinderung geschaffen.
Auch Firmen bekommen Geld, wenn sie zum Beispiel: • eine Rampe für Rollstuhlfahrer bauen oder • einen Computer·arbeitsplatz für Blinde einrichten.
Anker·zentrum in Lebach beginnt mit seiner Arbeit
Wichtiger Termin für Asyl·bewerber in Lebach:
Die Landes·aufnahme·stelle ist jetzt offiziell ein Anker·zentrum.
Deshalb hat Bundes·innen·minister Horst Seehofer am Montag ( 29.10. ) Lebach besucht.
Das Wort " Anker " ist eine Abkürzung.
" Anker " steht für " An ( kunft ), k ( ommunale Verteilung ), E ( ntscheidung ) und R ( ückführung ) ".
Dort arbeiten Behörden sehr eng zusammen.
Das Ziel ist: • Asyl·anträge sollen schneller bearbeitet werden • Menschen, die nicht in Deutschland bleiben dürfen, sollen schneller abgeschoben werden
Horst Seehofer findet Anker·zentren sehr gut.
Er will mehr Anker·zentren in Deutschland.
Das Anker·zentrum in Lebach hat er gelobt.
Er hat von " Vorbild·charakter " gesprochen.
Was ändert sich in Lebach ?
• Es gibt mehr Geld vom Bund.
Das Geld bekommen Verbände, die sich um Flüchtlinge kümmern.
Sie bieten zum Beispiel Sprach· kurse oder Musik·kurse an.
• Es kommen mehr Bundes·polizisten.
Diese Polizisten bringen die Flüchtlinge, die abgeschoben werden, zum Beispiel zum Flughafen.
Elektro·schock·geräte für Polizisten
Polizisten im Saarland testen in den kommenden 6 Monaten sogenannte Taser.
Das sind Elektro·schock·geräte, die schwache Strom·stöße abgeben.
Wer den Taser berührt, kann sich kurze Zeit nicht bewegen.
Warum testen die Polizisten diese Taser ?
Polizisten werden immer öfter angegriffen.
Die Idee ist: Haben Polizisten einen Taser, werden sie nicht mehr so oft angegriffen.
Der Taser soll also Angreifer abschrecken.
Die Geräte werden getestet vom Wach- und Streifendienst in: • Neunkirchen • Saarlouis • Saarbrücken-St. Johann
AKK ist neue CDU-Chefin
Die saarländische Politikerin Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer ( Abkürzung: AKK ) ist neue Chefin der Partei CDU.
Das haben wichtige Mitglieder der CDU am Freitag ( 7. Dezember ) in der Stadt Hamburg entschieden.
AKK ist bisher die General·sekretärin der CDU gewesen.
Was bedeutet das ?
Eine General·sekretärin steht direkt unter dem Partei·chef.
Sie führt in einer Partei die täglichen Geschäfte.
Das bedeutet: • Die General·sekretärin vermittelt bei einem Streit • Die General·sekretärin plant Wahl·kämpfe • Die General·sekretärin leitet Diskussionen.
Jetzt ist AKK die Chefin der Partei CDU.
Bisher war das Angela Merkel.
Sie wollte aber nicht mehr weiter·machen.
Merkel will nur Bundes·kanzlerin bleiben.
AKK hat in Hamburg 2 Konkurrenten gehabt:
Auch der Gesundheits·minister Jens Spahn und das CDU-Mitglied Friedrich Merz haben gesagt: Wir wollen Chef der CDU werden.
Die Wahl musste 2 Mal gemacht werden.
AKK hat am Ende gegen Friedrich Merz gewonnen.
Das war knapp.
AKK hat gesagt: Sie will, dass sich in der CDU alle wieder vertragen.
Kramp-Karrenbauer hat auch gesagt: Ich werde Kanzlerin Merkel widersprechen, wenn es nötig ist.
Weniger Geld für Flüchtlinge ?
Die Bundes·regierung will den Bundes·ländern und den Kommunen für Flüchtlinge weniger Geld geben.
Statt fast 5 Milliarden Euro jedes Jahr will die Bundes·regierung nur noch gut 1 Milliarde Euro geben.
Das macht die saarländischen Politiker wütend.
Sie sagen: Wir haben schon jetzt zu wenig Geld.
Der saarländische Minister·präsident Tobias Hans sagt: Wir brauchen das Geld vom Bund, um unsere Ausgaben für die Flüchtlinge be·zahlen zu können.
Flüchtlinge zu integrieren ist eine Aufgabe für alle - auch für den Bund.
Der St. Ingberter Ober·bürger·meister Hans Wagner und der Saarbrücker Bürger·meister Ralf Latz sagen: Integration fängt in den Kommunen an.
Flüchtlinge brauchen zum Beispiel • eine Wohnung • Essen und Trinken • Sprach·kurse
Auch das kostet viel Geld.
Die Minister·präsidenten in anderen Bundes·ländern finden den Plan des Bundes auch nicht gut.
Sie wollen sich gemeinsam dagegen wehren.
Viel Fein·staub an Silvester
Das Feuer·werk an Silvester hat im Saarland sehr hohe Fein·staub·werte verursacht.
Der Fein·staub wurde durch die explodierenden Feuerwerks·raketen in die Luft gebracht.
Den höchsten Fein·staub·wert hat es an Silvester in der Mainzer Straße in Saarbrücken gegeben.
Der Wert war fast 40 mal so hoch wie normalerweise.
Viel Fein·staub wurde auch in Ottweiler gemessen.
Der Fein·staub ist ungesund für Menschen und Tiere.
Der Fein·staub wird eingeamtet.
Schon vor Silvester hatten Experten gesagt: An Silvester werden durch die Raketen in ganz Deutschland rund 4500 Tonnen Fein·staub freigesetzt.
Das sind rund 15 Prozent von dem, was in einem Jahr durch die Abgase von Autos produziert wird.
Land will Sucht·hilfe ver·bessern
Im Saarland sind in den vergangenen Jahren immer mehr Menschen durch Drogen gestorben.
Die Landes·regierung sagt deshalb: Wir müssen süchtigen Menschen besser helfen.
Dazu ist am Mittwoch ( 16. Januar ) eine Studie vorgestellt worden.
Sie zeigt, dass viele verschiedene Stellen im Saarland Hilfe an·bieten.
Die Studie zeigt aber auch: Die Hilfen arbeiten nicht gut zusammen.
Wenn ein drogen·abhängiger Mensch zu mehr als einer Beratung geht, werden Informationen nicht ausgetauscht.
Die Landes·regierung will das ändern.
Die Landes·regierung will die süchtigen Menschen auch begleiten.
Ein Helfer soll die süchtigen Menschen dabei unterstützen • zum Arzt zu gehen • von den Drogen weg·zukommen • eine Arbeit zu finden • eine Wohnung zu finden
Im Saarland sind im vergangenen Jahr 26 Menschen gestorben, weil sie zu viele Drogen genommen haben.
Im Jahr 2017 waren es 29 Drogen·tote.
Kaum noch Impfstoff gegen Grippe im Saarland
Im Saarland gibt es kaum noch Impf·stoff gegen Grippe.
Darauf hat die saarländische Apotheker·kammer hingewiesen.
Die saarländische Apotheker·kammer sagt: Es sind nur wenige Impf·dosen aus Polen und Frankreich gekommen.
Das saarländische Gesundheits·ministerium weiß aber nicht genau, wie viele Impf·dosen aus dem Ausland ins Saarland geliefert wurden.
Auch die Kassenärztliche Vereinigung im Saarland sagt: In den saarländischen Arzt·praxen gibt es nur noch wenig bis keinen Impf·stoff gegen Grippe.
Wer sich trotzdem impfen lassen will, der soll sich bei seinem Haus·arzt melden.
In den Hausarzt·praxen gibt es Warte·listen.
Polizei·aktion gegen Schleuser
Die Bundes·polizei hat an der Autobahn 8 bei Perl am Mittwoch ( 9. Januar ) Last·wagen und Klein·transporter kontrolliert.
Die Polizei sagt: Mit solchen Kontrollen wollen wir Schleuser bekämpfen.
Schleuser sind Menschen·schmuggler.
Sie versuchen, unerlaubt Flüchtlinge in ein Land zu bringen.
Die Polizei sagt: Mit den Kontrollen sollen aber nicht nur unerlaubte Einreisen verhindert werden.
Mit den Kontrollen wollen wir auch Lebens·gefahr für die Menschen abwenden, die in Lastwagen versteckt und geschmuggelt werden.
Die Polizei hat am Rastplatz Mosel·tal bei Perl insgesamt 123 Lastwagen und 3 Busse kontrolliert.
Unerlaubte Einreisen hat die Polizei nicht festgestellt.
Im Jahr 2018 hat die Polizei in 4 Fällen Menschen entdeckt, die sich in Laderäumen von Lastwagen versteckten.
Friedliche Demonstrationen am 1. Mai
In vielen Städten in Deutschland waren Demonstrationen.
Bei einer Demonstration gehen viele Menschen gemeinsam durch die Stadt.
Diese Menschen sind mit etwas nicht einverstanden.
Deshalb rufen die Menschen laut ihre Meinung.
Die Demonstrationen waren am 1. Mai.
Und bei den Demonstrationen waren sehr viele Menschen.
Auch in vielen Städten in Nord·deutschland waren Demonstrationen.
Zum Beispiel:
• In Lehrte.
Lehrte ist eine Stadt in Niedersachsen.
• In Kiel.
Kiel ist die Hauptstadt von Schleswig-Holstein.
• In Rostock.
Rostock ist eine Stadt in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
• Und in Hamburg.
Die Demonstrationen
Die Demonstrationen waren von den Gewerkschaften.
Eine Gewerkschaft hilft Mitarbeitern zum Beispiel bei einem Streit mit der Firma.
Eine Gewerkschaft sagt zum Beispiel: Die Arbeiter sollen mehr Geld bekommen.
Bei den Demonstrationen haben die Gewerkschaften zum Beispiel gesagt: Viele Menschen bekommen für ihre Arbeit zu wenig Geld.
Das ist nicht gerecht.
Deshalb wollen wir: Jeder Arbeiter muss gerecht behandelt werden.
Das heißt: Die Arbeiter sollen zum Beispiel mehr Geld bekommen.
Der 1. Mai
Die Gewerkschaften machen jedes Jahr Demonstrationen am 1. Mai.
Der 1. Mai ist ein Feier·tag.
An einem Feier·tag müssen die meisten Menschen nicht arbeiten.
Der 1. Mai heißt: Tag der Arbeit.
Und der 1. Mai ist ein Gedenk·tag.
Einige Menschen denken am 1. Mai nämlich an ein wichtiges Ereignis.
Am 1. Mai 1886 haben Arbeiter in Nord·amerika für ihre Rechte gekämpft.
Zum Beispiel für eine gerechte Bezahlung.
Keine Krawalle
Oft waren am 1. Mai Krawalle.
Bei Krawallen machen Menschen zum Beispiel mit Absicht Feuer.
Oder die Menschen machen Fenster·scheiben kaputt.
Diese Krawalle waren zum Beispiel in Hamburg.
Und diese Krawalle waren oft nach den Demonstrationen.
Aber dieses Jahr waren keine Krawalle.
Die Polizei hat gesagt: So friedlich waren die Demonstrationen lange nicht mehr.
Wir hatten nur sehr wenige Einsätze.
Darüber freuen wir uns.
Besonderes Museum wieder geöffnet
In Schleswig-Holstein hat ein besonderes Museum wieder geöffnet.
In einem Museum können Menschen besondere Dinge sehen.
Diese Dinge sind oft sehr alt.
Und diese Dinge sind oft sehr wertvoll.
Diese Dinge sind zum Beispiel Bilder von berühmten Malern.
Das Museum ist in der Nähe von Schleswig.
Das Museum heißt Haithabu.
Und das Museum zeigt: So haben die Wikinger gelebt.
Die Wikinger haben vor über 1000 Jahren gelebt.
Die meisten Wikinger haben in Nord·europa gelebt.
Einige von den Wikingern waren Seefahrer.
Viele Menschen hatten Angst vor diesen Seefahrern.
Diese Seefahrer haben nämlich zum Beispiel Dörfer überfallen.
Aber die meisten Wikinger waren: • Bauern. • Oder Hand·werker.
Das Museum
Das Museum war lange geschlossen.
Hand·werker haben das Museum nämlich umgebaut.
Aber jetzt sind die Handwerker fertig.
Und die Menschen können das Museum wieder besuchen.
In dem Museum sind viele Dinge von den Wikingern.
Diese Dinge sind zum Beispiel: • Boote. • Werkzeug. • Oder Schmuck.
Ein Sprecher von dem Museum hat gesagt: Archäologen haben im vergangen Jahr Gold·schmuck gefunden.
Archäologen sind Forscher.
Archäologen suchen sehr alte Dinge.
Zum Beispiel:
• Knochen.
• Schmuck.
• Und Werkzeuge.
Und Archäologen untersuchen diese alten Dinge.
Dieser Gold·schmuck ist von Wikingern.
Und diesen Gold·schmuck können die Besucher jetzt im Museum sehen.
Neue Moschee in Hamburg
In Hamburg hat eine neue Moschee eröffnet.
Eine Moschee ist ein besonderes Gebäude.
In einer Moschee beten Muslime.
Muslime gehören zum Islam.
Der Islam ist eine von den 5 großen Religionen.
Die 4 anderen großen Religionen sind: • Das Christentum. • Der Hinduismus. • Der Buddhismus. • Und das Judentum.
Diese neue Moschee ist in Hamburg-Horn.
Horn ist ein Stadt·teil von Hamburg.
Und diese Moschee war früher eine Kirche.
Evangelische Kirche verkauft Gebäude
Bis zum Jahr 2002 war das Gebäude eine Kirche.
Der Name von der Kirche war Kapernaum-Kirche.
Die Kirche war von der Evangelischen Kirche.
Aber dann hat die Evangelische Kirche mehrere Kirchen verkauft.
Auch die Kapernaum-Kirche.
Die Evangelische Kirche hat gesagt: Früher waren immer sehr viele Menschen in unseren Kirchen.
Aber jetzt sind nicht mehr so viele Menschen in unseren Kirchen.
Deshalb brauchen wir nicht mehr so viele Kirchen.
Und deshalb haben wir einige von unseren Kirchen verkauft.
5 Jahre Umbau
Im Jahr 2012 hat ein Verein das Gebäude gekauft.
Dieser Verein ist ein islamischer Verein.
Der Umbau von dem Gebäude hat 5 Jahre gedauert.
Und der Umbau von dem Gebäude hat 4 Millionen Euro gekostet.
Ein Sprecher von der Moschee hat gesagt: Wir freuen uns über die Eröffnung von der Moschee.
Aber die Moschee ist noch nicht fertig.
Wir müssen nämlich zum Beispiel noch den Turm von der Moschee reparieren.
31. Oktober soll Feier·tag werden
In Hamburg gibt es wahrscheinlich bald einen neuen Feier·tag.
An einem Feier·tag müssen die meisten Menschen nicht arbeiten.
Ein Feier·tag ist zum Beispiel Neu·jahr.
Neu·jahr ist immer am 1. Januar.
Viele Politiker in Hamburg haben nämlich gesagt: In Hamburg gibt es jedes Jahr nur 9 Feier·tage.
Aber in vielen anderen Bundes·ländern gibt es mehr Feier·tage.
Deshalb soll es in Hamburg bald einen neuen Feier·tag geben.
Jetzt haben sich Politiker von mehreren Parteien geeinigt.
Und diese Politiker haben gesagt: Der 31. Oktober soll jedes Jahr in Hamburg ein Feier·tag sein.
Der 31. Oktober
Vor 500 Jahren hat es nur eine Kirche gegeben.
Diese Kirche war die katholische Kirche.
Aber viele Menschen waren mit der katholischen Kirche nicht zufrieden.
Diesen Menschen haben zum Beispiel gesagt: Die Kirche hat zu viel Geld
Und sie gibt zu viel Geld für bestimmte Dinge aus.
Zum Beispiel für teure Kirchen-Gebäude.
Einer von diesen Menschen war Martin Luther.
Martin Luther hat Texte geschrieben.
In diesen Texten hat Martin Luther zum Beispiel geschrieben: Das finde ich an der katholischen Kirche nicht gut.
Und das muss sich in der katholischen Kirche ändern.
Viele Menschen haben die Texte von Martin Luther gelesen.
Und diese Menschen haben gedacht: Martin Luther hat recht.
Deshalb wollten diese Menschen die Kirche erneuern.
Diese Erneuerung von der Kirche heißt Reformation.
Seit der Reformation gibt es eine neue Kirche in Deutschland.
Diese Kirche heißt evangelische Kirche.
Ein Text von Martin Luther war sehr wichtig für die Reformation.
Viele Menschen sagen: Mit diesem Text hat die Reformation richtig angefangen.
Diesen Text konnten die Menschen am 31. Oktober 1517 lesen.
Deshalb ist der 31. Oktober auch heute noch für viele Menschen ein wichtiger Tag.
Abstimmung über Feier·tag
Der 31. Oktober soll bald nicht nur in Hamburg ein Feier·tag sein.
Auch in anderen Bundes·ländern soll der 31. Oktober bald ein Feier·tag sein:
• In Niedersachsen.
• In Schleswig-Holstein.
• Und in Bremen.
In Mecklenburg Vorpommern ist der 31. Oktober schon ein Feier·tag.
Bald sind in den Parlamenten von den Bundes·ländern wichtige Abstimmungen.
Im Parlament sind viele Politiker.
Diese Politiker sind von verschiedenen Parteien.
Und diese Politiker treffen wichtige Entscheidungen für das Bundes·land.
Bei den Abstimmungen entscheiden die Parlamente: • Der 31. Oktober ist ein neuer Feier·tag. • Oder der 31. Oktober ist kein neuer Feier·tag.
Olaf Scholz wartet
In Hamburg war eine Presse·konferenz.
Eine Presse·konferenz ist eine Veranstaltung.
Bei dieser Veranstaltung sind Journalisten.
Ein Journalist arbeitet zum Beispiel für: • Das Fernsehen. • Oder das Radio.
Und bei der Veranstaltung sind bekannte Menschen.
Zum Beispiel:
• Politiker.
• Oder Sportler
Die bekannten Menschen beantworten zum Beispiel Fragen von den Journalisten.
Die Presse·konferenz war mit Olaf Scholz.
Olaf Scholz ist der Bürger·meister von Hamburg.
Ein Bürger·meister ist der Chef von einer Stadt.
Und Olaf Scholz ist von der SPD.
SPD ist die Abkürzung für Sozial·demokratische Partei Deutschlands.
Die Presse·konferenz
Bei der Presse·konferenz waren sehr viele Journalisten.
Diese Journalisten wollten nämlich wissen: Braucht Hamburg einen neuen Bürger·meister ?
Vor der Presse·konferenz haben Fach·leute nämlich gesagt: Olaf Scholz verlässt vielleicht bald Hamburg.
Und Olaf Scholz arbeitet vielleicht bald in Berlin.
Berlin ist die Haupt·stadt von Deutschland.
Die Journalisten haben Olaf Scholz gefragt: Verlassen Sie bald Hamburg ?
Olaf Scholz hat gesagt: Ich kann noch nicht sagen: Ich verlasse Hamburg.
Oder ich verlasse Hamburg nicht.
Ich muss nämlich noch auf eine große Abstimmung warten.
Diese Abstimmung ist von den Mitgliedern von der SPD.
Und diese Abstimmung ist in den nächsten Wochen.
Reparatur von Segel·schiff dauert lange
Fach·leute reparieren in Bremerhaven ein besonderes Segel·schiff.
Bremerhaven ist eine Stadt an der Nord·see.
Dieses besondere Segel·schiff heißt Gorch Fock.
Die Gorch Fock ist ein Segel·schiff von der Bundes·wehr.
Die Bundes·wehr ist die Armee von Deutschland.
Die Bundes·wehr hat auf der Gorch Fock viele Soldaten ausgebildet.
Das Segel·schiff ist 60 Jahre alt.
Und das Segel·schiff ist sehr kaputt.
Jetzt haben die Fach·leute gesagt: Die Reparatur von dem Segel·schiff ist wahrscheinlich erst 2020 fertig.

Und Public Viewing heißt: Öffentliches Anschauen.
Beim Public Viewing gibt es einen großen Bildschirm.
Viele Menschen gucken gemeinsam auf diesen Bildschirm.
Zum Beispiel bei einem Fußball·spiel.
Dieses Public Viewing ist zur Fußball-WM.
Fußball-WM ist die Abkürzung für Fußball-Welt·meisterschaft.
Bei der Fußball-WM spielen die besten Fußball·mannschaften von der Welt.
Der Chef von der Kieler Woche hat gesagt: Viele Menschen interessieren sich für die Fußball-WM.
Deshalb zeigen wir 2 Fußball·spiele von der deutschen National·mannschaft.
In der deutschen National·mannschaft spielen die besten Fußball·spieler aus Deutschland.
Viele Menschen demonstrieren
In Nord·deutschland waren viele Demonstrationen.
Bei einer Demonstration treffen sich viele Menschen.
Dann gehen diese Menschen gemeinsam durch die Stadt.
Diese Menschen sind mit etwas nicht einverstanden.
Zum Beispiel mit einer Entscheidung von Politikern.
Deshalb rufen die Menschen laut ihre Meinung.
Diese Demonstrationen waren in 16 Städten.
Zum Beispiel:
• In Kiel.
Kiel ist die Hauptstadt von Schleswig-Holstein.
• In Rostock.
Rostock ist eine Stadt in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
• Und in Bremen.
Die größte Demonstration war in Hamburg.
Bei den Demonstrationen waren sehr viele Menschen.
Diese Menschen arbeiten in der Metall- und Elektro·industrie.
In der Metall- und Elektro·industrie arbeiten zum Beispiel: • Mechaniker. • Oder Schlosser.
Warum demonstrieren die Menschen ?
Die Menschen bei den Demonstrationen haben gesagt: Wir sind nicht zufrieden.
Wir bekommen nämlich nicht genug Geld für unsere Arbeit.
Und wir möchten andere Arbeits·zeiten.
Einige von uns wollen zum Beispiel weniger arbeiten.
Wichtiges Treffen
Morgen ist ein wichtiges Treffen in Hamburg.
Bei dem Treffen sind Arbeit·geber.
Arbeit·geber sind die Chefs von Mitarbeitern.
Arbeit·geber bezahlen die Mitarbeiter für ihre Arbeit.
Und bei diesem Treffen ist die IG Metall.
Die IG Metall ist eine Gewerkschaft.
Eine Gewerkschaft ist eine Vereinigung von Mitarbeitern.
Eine Gewerkschaft hilft Mitarbeitern zum Beispiel bei einem Streit mit der Firma.
Bei dem Treffen sprechen die Arbeit·geber mit der IG Metall.
Dann einigen sich vielleicht die Arbeit·geber und die IG Metall.
Und dann bekommen die Menschen in der Metall- und Elektro·industrie vielleicht mehr Geld.
Die Arbeit·geber und die IG Metall haben sich schon öfter getroffen.
Aber die Arbeit·geber und die IG Metall haben sich noch nicht geeinigt.
Deshalb haben die Menschen in der Metall- und Elektro·industrie schon mal gestreikt.
Das heißt: Diese Menschen haben einige Stunden nicht gearbeitet.
Und diese Menschen haben protestiert.
Totes Baby:
Mutter muss ins Gefängnis
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern war ein Prozess.
Ein Prozess ist ein Streit vor Gericht.
Bei einem Prozess entscheidet das Gericht: • Hat ein Mensch etwas Verbotenes getan ? Dann bekommt dieser Mensch eine Strafe. • Oder hat ein Mensch nichts Verbotenes getan ? Dann bekommt dieser Mensch keine Strafe.
Der Prozess war in Schwerin.
Bei dem Prozess hat das Gericht eine Mutter verurteilt.
Die Mutter hat nämlich ihr Baby getötet.
Deshalb muss die Mutter jetzt für 5 Jahre und 6 Monate ins Gefängnis.
Was ist passiert ?
Das Gericht hat gesagt: Die Mutter wohnt in Wittenburg.
Wittenburg ist eine Stadt in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
Und die Mutter hat in ihrer Wohnung ein Baby bekommen.
Aber kein Mensch sollte von dem Baby wissen.
Die Mutter wollte das Baby nämlich nicht behalten.
Aber in der Wohnung war auch der Vater von dem Baby.
Der Vater hat geschlafen.
Und der Vater sollte nicht wissen: Die Mutter hat ein Baby bekommen.
Deshalb hat die Mutter ihr Baby kurz nach der Geburt erstickt.
Dann hat die Mutter ihr totes Baby in einem Gefrier·schrank versteckt.
Ein Gefrier·schrank ist ein Gerät.
In einem Gefrier·schrank ist es sehr kalt.
In einem Gefrier·schrank können Menschen zum Beispiel Lebensmittel einfrieren.
Nach 2 Jahren hat ein Freund von der Mutter das tote Baby in einen Wald gelegt.
In dem Wald haben Menschen das tote Baby gefunden.
Die Polizei hat nach der Mutter von dem toten Baby gesucht.
Dann hat die Polizei Hinweise gefunden.
Diese Hinweise haben gezeigt: Diese Frau ist die Mutter von dem toten Baby.
Und diese Mutter hat wahrscheinlich ihr Baby getötet.
Die Mutter hat bei dem Prozess gesagt: Ich habe mein Baby nicht getötet.
Aber das Gericht hat der Mutter nicht geglaubt.
Das Gericht hat gesagt: Die Mutter hat die Tat nicht geplant.
Aber die Mutter hat ihr Baby getötet.
Deshalb muss die Mutter jetzt ins Gefängnis.
Baden in vielen Seen verboten
In vielen Seen in Niedersachsen ist das Baden verboten.
Das heißt: In diesen Seen dürfen keine Menschen baden.
In diesen Seen sind nämlich viele Blau·algen.
Blau·algen sind Bakterien.
Bakterien sind sehr kleine Lebewesen.
Diese Bakterien sind im Wasser.
Und diese Bakterien sind für Menschen gefährlich.
Diese Bakterien machen Menschen nämlich krank.
Diese Seen sind zum Beispiel: • Der Seeburger See. • Der Dümmer. • Und die Thülsfelder Tal·sperre.
Viele Blau·algen durch Hitze
In Nord·deutschland ist es sehr heiß.
Und in Nord·deutschland ist es sehr trocken.
In Nord·deutschland hat es nämlich wenig geregnet.
Fachleute haben gesagt: Bei diesem Wetter können im Wasser Blau·algen entstehen.
Blau·algen sind giftig.
Menschen schlucken beim Baden Blau·algen ?
Dann können diese Menschen krank werden.
Diese Menschen bekommen zum Beispiel: • Durchfall. • Oder Erbrechen.
Besonders gefährlich sind Blau·algen für Kinder.
Viele Bade·stellen gesperrt
Fach·leute haben Seen in Niedersachsen untersucht.
Die Fachleute wollten zum Beispiel wissen: Ist das Wasser von den Seen sauber ?
Jetzt haben die Fach·leute gesagt: Im Wasser von vielen Seen sind Blau·algen.
Deshalb ist das Baden in diesen Seen verboten.
Die Blau·algen sind auch für Tiere gefährlich.
Deshalb sollen auch keine Tiere in den Seen baden.
Im letzten Jahr sind nämlich mehrere Hunde durch Blau·algen gestorben.
Zu viele Mieter:
Behörde kontrolliert Haus
In Hamburg war ein großer Einsatz.
Dieser Einsatz war in Wandsbek.
Wandsbek ist ein Stadt·teil im Osten von Hamburg.
Bei dem Einsatz haben etwa 150 Menschen ein Haus kontrolliert.
Diese Menschen waren: • Von der Polizei. • Und von der Sozial·behörde.
Die Sozial·behörde kümmert sich um Menschen.
Diese Menschen sind oft arm.
Die Sozial·behörde hat gesagt: Das Haus ist ein Hotel.
In einem Hotel können Menschen für einige Tage übernachten.
Die Menschen müssen für die Übernachtung Geld bezahlen.
Aber wir glauben: Der Vermieter nutzt das Haus nicht als Hotel.
In dem Haus wohnen nämlich viele Menschen für längere Zeit.
Das ist verboten.
Was ist passiert ?
Nach der Kontrolle von dem Haus hat die Sozial·behörde gesagt: In dem Haus sind kleine Wohnungen.
In diesen kleinen Wohnungen leben viele Menschen.
Diese Menschen sind aus Ost·europa.
Und diese Menschen brauchen Hilfe.
Diese Menschen sprechen nämlich zum Beispiel nicht gut deutsch.
Der Vermieter hat gesagt: Ich helfe euch.
Ich vermiete euch Wohnungen.
Aber der Vermieter wollte viel Geld verdienen.
Deshalb hat der Vermieter die Wohnungen an zu viele Menschen vermietet.
Das ist verboten.
Deshalb ermittelt die Polizei gegen den Vermieter.
Die Sozial·behörde hat auch gesagt: Die Wohnungen sind zu klein für so viele Menschen.
Und die Wohnungen sind in einem sehr schlechten Zustand.
Das heißt: Viele Dinge in den Wohnungen sind kaputt.
Zum Beispiel die Wände.
Deshalb prüfen wir jetzt: Wie können wir den Menschen helfen ?
Polizei·schule wird größer
Die Polizei in Hamburg braucht viele neue Polizisten.
Deshalb werden in Hamburg viele neue Polizisten ausgebildet.
Diese Ausbildung ist in der Polizei·schule.
Aber die Polizei·schule ist zu klein für die neuen Polizisten.
In der Polizei·schule sind nämlich zu wenig Räume für die neuen Polizisten.
Deshalb bekommt die Polizei·schule bald mehr Räume.
Die Polizei·schule in Hamburg
Die Polizei·schule in Hamburg ist in Winterhude.
Winterhude ist ein Stadt·teil von Hamburg.
Die Polizei·schule in Hamburg heißt Polizei·akademie.
Akademie ist ein anderes Wort für Schule.
In der Polizei·schule lernen die neuen Polizisten viele Dinge.
Zum Beispiel:
• Gesetze.
• Oder Schießen.
Die Ausbildung in der Polizei·schule dauert 3 Jahre.
30 neue Räume für Polizei·schule
Der Sprecher von der Polizei in Hamburg ist Timo Zill.
Timo Zill hat gesagt: In diesem Jahr bilden wir 600 neue Polizisten aus.
Und im nächsten Jahr bilden wir noch mehr neue Polizisten aus.
Aber die Polizei·schule ist zu klein für noch mehr neue Polizisten.
Deshalb bauen wir die Polizei·schule aus.
Und deshalb bekommt die Polizei·schule 3 neue Etagen.
In diesen 3 neuen Etagen sind dann 30 neue Räume.
Die Bau·arbeiten sollen 2019 beginnen.
37 Jahre nach Verbrechen:
Mann festgenommen
In Hamburg hat die Polizei einen Mann festgenommen.
Die Polizei glaubt nämlich: Der Mann hat schlimme Verbrechen gemacht.
Diese Verbrechen waren vor mehr als 37 Jahren.
Was ist passiert ?
Die Verbrechen waren im Jahr 1980.
Damals hat ein Mann 2 Mädchen angegriffen.
Erst wollte der Mann ein Mädchen vergewaltigen.
Das heißt: Der Mann wollte das Mädchen zum Sex zwingen.
Aber das Mädchen konnte weglaufen.
Deshalb hat der Mann das Mädchen nicht vergewaltigt.
Einige Monate später hat der Mann ein anderes Mädchen angegriffen.
Der Mann hat dieses Mädchen mit einem Messer sehr schwer verletzt.
Dann wollte der Mann dieses Mädchen vergewaltigen.
Aber dann sind andere Menschen gekommen.
Deshalb ist der Mann weggelaufen.
Und der Mann hat das Mädchen nicht vergewaltigt.
Damals hat die Polizei sehr lange nach dem Mann gesucht.
Aber die Polizei hat den Mann nicht gefunden.
Jetzt hat die Polizei neue Hinweise gefunden.
Und die Polizei hat ein Foto von einem Messer veröffentlicht.
Die Polizei hat gesagt: Dieses Messer hat der Mann bei der Tat benutzt.
Und die Polizei hat gefragt: Wem gehört dieses Messer ?
Dann hat sich ein Mensch gemeldet.
Dieser Mensch hat gesagt: Das Messer gehört einem Mann.
Und ich kenne diesen Mann.
Diesen Mann hat die Polizei jetzt festgenommen.
Bundes·garten·schau in Rostock
In Rostock ist bald eine besondere Ausstellung.
Rostock ist eine Stadt in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
Diese Ausstellung heißt Bundes·garten·schau.
Bei der Bundes·garten·schau können Besucher viele besondere Gärten sehen.
In diesen Gärten sind zum Beispiel: • Besondere Blumen. • Besondere Bäume. • Oder besondere Kräuter.
Sehr viele Menschen interessieren sich für diese Gärten.
Deshalb sind sehr viele Besucher bei einer Bundes·garten·schau.
Der Bürgermeister von Rostock ist Roland Methling.
Roland Methling hat gesagt: Jetzt wissen wir: Die Bundes·garten·schau 2025 ist in Rostock.
Darüber freuen wir uns sehr.
Die Bundes·garten·schau ist sehr gut für Rostock.
Zur Bundes·garten·schau kommen nämlich viele Besucher.
Die Bundes·garten·schau
Die Bundes·garten·schau ist sehr groß.
Und die Bundes·garten·schau ist sehr teuer.
Deshalb bekommt Rostock 100 Millionen Euro für die Bundes·garten·schau.
Roland Methling hat gesagt: Wir müssen noch viel für die Bundes·garten·schau machen.
Wir wollen zum Beispiel eine neue Halle bauen.
Aber wir freuen uns schon sehr auf die Bundes·garten·schau.
Angriff auf Politiker
Frank Magnitz ist ein Politiker von der Partei AfD.
3 Männer haben ihn angegriffen und schwer verletzt.
Die Bundes-Regierung und alle Parteien waren entsetzt.
Die AfD hat gesagt: Das war ein Mord-Anschlag.
Sie hat auch die anderen Parteien beschuldigt.
Sie meint: Weil die Politiker und die Medien die AfD immer so schlecht machen, hat es den Angriff auf Frank Magnitz gegeben.
Die anderen Parteien haben gesagt: Der Angriff war schlimm.
Und: Gewalt hat in der Politik nichts zu suchen.
Außen-Minister Heiko Maas hat gefordert: Die Täter müssen bestraft werden.
Auch Bundes-Präsident Frank-Walter Steinmeier hat den Angriff kritisiert.
Er meint: " Das ist gefährlich für die Demokratie ".
Die AfD hat zuerst gesagt: Die Männer haben Frank Magnitz mit einem Holz-Stück angegriffen und gegen seinen Kopf getreten.
Die Staats-Anwaltschaft sagt: Das stimmt nicht.
Auf einem Video sieht man, dass die Männer Frank Magnitz in den Rücken springen und dann weg-laufen.
Sie sagt auch: Die schweren Verletzungen kommen von dem Sturz.
Steuer für Moscheen ?
Die Kirchen in Deutschland finanzieren sich über die Kirchen-Steuer.
Jetzt haben Politiker vorgeschlagen, dass es auch eine Steuer für Moscheen geben soll.
Die Politiker von der CDU und von der SPD sagen: Wenn die Moscheen Steuer-Geld erhalten, sind sie unabhängig.
Sie brauchen dann kein Geld aus dem Ausland.
Die Politiker sagen auch: Das Ausland kann dann keinen Einfluss mehr auf die Moscheen nehmen - zum Beispiel dadurch, dass es Imame schickt.
Imame nennt man die Prediger.
Die Moscheen können aber nicht einfach so Steuern erhalten.
Dafür müssen erst bestimmte rechtliche Bedingungen erfüllt sein.
Manche sagen jetzt: Moscheen dürfen nicht mit Kirchen gleich-gestellt werden.
Zur Zeit bekommen die Moscheen in Deutschland Geld vom Moscheen-Verband Ditib.
Kritiker glauben, er steht unter dem Einfluss von dem Land Türkei.
Streit über Raketen
Die Länder USA und Russland streiten über einen Abrüstungs-Vertrag.
In dem Vertrag steht, dass beide Länder nach und nach ihre Raketen verschrotten sollen.
Die USA sagen: Russland hält sich nicht an den Vertrag.
Und Russland sagt: Die USA halten sich nicht daran.
In dem Vertrag geht es um Raketen, die Atom-Bomben tragen können.
Vor mehr als 30 Jahren haben die beiden Länder beschlossen: Wir wollen die meisten von diesen Raketen abschaffen.
Lange Zeit hat das auch gut geklappt.
Aber jetzt nicht mehr.
Noch gilt der Vertrag.
Aber die USA drohen jetzt damit, ihn zu kündigen.
Und Russland sagt: Wenn die USA den Vertrag kündigen, dann werden wir noch weitere neue Waffen bauen.
Das Militär-Bündnis Nato hat Russland aufgefordert, sich sofort wieder an den Vertrag zu halten.
Regierung in Sicht
In Deutschland wird es bald eine neue Regierung geben.
Die Mitglieder von der SPD haben für eine Zusammen-Arbeit mit den Parteien CDU und CSU gestimmt.
Die Parteien haben auch ihre Minister schon benannt.
Diese Zusammen-Arbeit nennt man Große Koalition oder kurz GroKo.
Die Mehrheit von den SPD-Mitgliedern hat " Ja " zum Koalitions-Vertrag gesagt.
Einige Minister von der SPD werden nicht mehr zur neuen Regierung gehören.
Außen-Minister Sigmar Gabriel ist nicht mehr dabei.
Sein Amt soll Justiz-Minister Heiko Maas übernehmen.
Auch Umwelt-Ministerin Barbara Hendricks gibt ihr Amt ab.
Ihre Nachfolgerin wird Svenja Schulze.
Neue Familien-Ministerin wird die Politikerin Franziska Giffey.
Das Ministerium für Arbeit und Soziales übernimmt Hubertus Heil.
Neuer Finanzminister und Stellvertreter von Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel wird Olaf Scholz.
Er ist im Moment noch der Erste Bürgermeister in Hamburg.
Die Partei CSU will drei Männer als Minister nach Berlin schicken.
Einer davon ist Horst Seehofer.
Er ist Chef von der CSU.
Seehofer ist auch noch Minister-Präsident von Bayern.
Am 13. März tritt Seehofer als Minister-Präsident von Bayern zurück.
Dann soll Seehofer Innen-Minister von der neuen Bundes-Regierung werden.
Die Partei CDU hat schon vor einiger Zeit gesagt, wer Minister wird.
Am 14. März soll der Bundestag Angela Merkel wieder zur Bundes-Kanzlerin wählen.
AfD Spenden-Skandal
Der Partei AfD wurde viel Geld gespendet.
Das Geld kam aus dem Ausland.
In Deutschland sind große Partei-Spenden verboten, wenn sie aus Ländern kommen, die nicht zu der Europäischen Union gehören.
Deshalb gibt es jetzt Streit.
Die Partei AfD hat von einer Firma aus dem Land Schweiz 130000 Euro erhalten.
Das Gesetz sagt aber: Parteien in Deutschland dürfen keine Spenden annehmen, wenn sie aus Ländern kommen, die nicht zu der EU gehören.
Die Schweiz gehört nicht zu der EU.
Das Geld hätte die AfD sofort zurück zahlen müssen.
Das hat sie aber nicht gemacht.
Außerdem hätte die AfD die Spende dem Bundestag melden müssen.
Auch das hat sie nicht getan.
Politiker von anderen Parteien kritisieren die AfD deshalb.
Sie sagen: Die AfD hat gegen das Gesetz verstoßen.
Deshalb will die Staats-Anwaltschaft jetzt ermitteln.
Die AfD hat auch aus dem Land Niederlande eine Spende erhalten.
Das Geld kam von einer Stiftung.
Partei-Spenden aus dem EU-Land Niederlande verstoßen nicht grundsätzlich gegen das Gesetz.
Aber Spenden aus einem EU-Land müssen dem Bundestag gemeldet werden, wenn sie mehr als 50000 Euro betragen.
Die AfD hat aber erst sehr spät die Spende gemeldet.
Beide Spenden gingen an den AfD-Kreis-Verband am Bodensee.
Das ist der Verband, in dem die AfD-Politikerin Alice Weidel Mitglied ist.
Politiker von anderen Parteien sagen: Alice Weidel hat von den Spenden gewusst.
Deshalb muss sie zurück treten.
Die AfD ist nicht die einzige Partei mit Ärger um Spenden.
Auch andere Parteien haben schon Spenden-Skandale gehabt.
Die AfD hat aber oft gesagt: wir sind da besser als die alten Parteien.
Politiker verhandeln über Regierung
In Deutschland gibt es immer noch keine neue Bundes-Regierung.
Politiker von den Parteien CDU, CSU und SPD sprechen darüber, ob sie zusammen regieren wollen.
Die Verhandlungen dauern wahrscheinlich noch bis Ostern.
Zuerst gibt es eine Woche lang Vor-Gespräche.
Diese Vor-Gespräche heißen Sondierungen.
Am Ende von den Sondierungen entscheiden die Parteien, ob sie über eine Koalition verhandeln.
Diese Koalitions-Verhandlungen würden dann mehrere Wochen dauern.
In Koalitions-Verhandlungen legen die Parteien fest, welche Politik sie zusammen machen wollen.
CDU, CSU und SPD sind sich bei vielen Themen noch nicht einig.
Die CSU will zum Beispiel, dass weniger Flüchtlinge nach Deutschland kommen.
Die SPD will eine neue Kranken-Versicherung für alle.
Streit über Anschlag
Zwischen den Ländern Groß-Britannien und Russland gibt es großen Ärger.
Dabei geht es um einen Anschlag auf einen früheren Spion.
Groß-Britannien sagt: Russland ist dafür verantwortlich.
Zur Strafe sollen 23 russische Diplomaten Groß-Britannien jetzt verlassen.
Die russische Regierung ist zornig.
Sie sagt: Das geht gar nicht.
Wir haben mit dem Anschlag nichts zu tun.
Der Ex-Spion heißt Sergej Skripal.
Er lebt in Groß-Britannien.
Skripal und seine Tochter sind am 4. März sehr krank in einem Park gefunden worden.
Die Polizei sagt: Sie sind vergiftet worden.
Es war Nerven-Gift.
Auch andere Länder glauben, dass Russland schuld ist - zum Beispiel das Land USA und das Land Frankreich.
Zusammen mit Groß-Britannien und Deutschland haben sie erklärt: Wir finden den Anschlag abscheulich.
Das ist ein Verstoß gegen internationales Recht.
Experten sind sehr besorgt über den Streit.
Sie befürchten: Die Beziehungen zwischen Russland und dem Westen könnten sehr schlecht werden.
Neue Kämpfe
In Syrien ist immer noch Krieg.
Die Kämpfe sind seit einigen Wochen schlimmer geworden.
Viele Menschen sind auf der Flucht.
Die Kämpfe sind vor allem in der Provinz Idlib.
Die liegt im Norden von Syrien an der Grenze zu dem Land Türkei.
In Idlib kämpfen Soldaten von der syrischen Regierung gegen Aufständische.
Beide Seiten haben mächtige Helfer:
Die Länder Russland und Iran unterstützen die syrische Regierung.
Die Türkei unterstützt die Aufständischen.
In der letzten Woche haben Kampf-Flugzeuge Bomben über Idlib abgeworfen.
Eigentlich haben Russland, der Iran und die Türkei vereinbart: In Idlib soll nicht gekämpft werden.
Die UNO sagt: Die Menschen, die in Idlib wohnen, leiden am meisten.
Seit Dezember mussten mehr als 100000 Menschen aus Idlib fliehen.
Viele fliehen Richtung Türkei.
Gipfel-Treffen
Die Länder Nord-Korea und Süd-Korea haben seit vielen Jahren Streit.
Jetzt haben sie beschlossen: Ihre Staats-Chefs werden sich treffen.
Politiker auf der ganzen Welt sind erleichtert.
Der Machthaber von Nord-Korea heißt Kim Jong Un.
Er will sich im April mit dem Präsidenten von Süd-Korea, Moon Jae In, treffen.
Die beiden Politiker wollen darüber reden, wie die Länder sich besser verstehen.
Außerdem hat Nord-Korea gesagt: Solange wir miteinander sprechen, wird es keine Atom- und Raketen-Tests geben.
Ein Treffen zwischen Staats-Chefs nennt man auch Gipfel-Treffen.
Das letzte Gipfel-Treffen zwischen Nord-Korea und Süd-Korea hat es vor 11 Jahren gegeben.
Politiker aus anderen Ländern sind erleichtert.
Der Präsident von den USA hat gesagt: Es wäre eine " großartige Sache ", wenn die beiden Staaten sich wieder besser verstehen.
Auch der Chef von den Vereinten Nationen sagt: Es ist wichtig, dass beide Länder miteinander reden.
Dann kann es irgendwann Frieden geben.
Viele Politiker sagen aber auch: Erst muss Nord-Korea seine Atom-Waffen abschaffen.
Missbrauch in der Kirche
In Deutschland haben Priester viele Jahre lang Kinder sexuell missbraucht.
Das heißt, die Kinder mussten mit ihnen Sex haben oder sind angefasst worden.
Fachleute haben darüber einen Bericht geschrieben.
Darin steht: Die Opfer sind mehr als 3500 Kinder und Jugendliche.
Für den Bericht haben die Fachleute viele Akten gelesen.
Es geht um die Zeit von 1946 bis 2014.
Also um fast 70 Jahre.
In dieser Zeit hat es immer wieder Missbrauch gegeben.
Dabei haben mehr als 1700 Priester und andere Leute von der Kirche mitgemacht.
Die meisten Opfer sind Kinder gewesen.
Viele von den Kindern sind Jungen gewesen.
Die Fachleute sagen: Viele sind jetzt erwachsen.
Aber sie leiden bis heute unter den Folgen von dem Missbrauch.
Der Chef von der Katholischen Kirche in Deutschland heißt Reinhard Marx.
Er sagt: Sexueller Missbrauch ist ein Verbrechen.
Die Täter müssen bestraft werden.
Er sagt auch: Die Kirche hat den Missbrauch lange Zeit nicht ernst genommen.
Sie hat manchmal sogar die Täter beschützt.
Das war ein schlimmer Fehler.
Er sagt auch: Ich schäme mich.
Marx hat sich bei allen Opfern entschuldigt.
Kämpfe in Tripolis
In der Stadt Tripolis in dem Land Libyen gibt es schwere Kämpfe.
Viele Menschen sind dabei getötet worden.
Jetzt haben die Milizen eine Waffen-Ruhe vereinbart.
Libyen ist ein Land im Norden von dem Kontinent Afrika.
Dort kämpfen seit vielen Jahren verschiedene Milizen um die Macht.
Besonders schlimm sind die Kämpfe zur Zeit in der Haupt-Stadt Tripolis.
Dort sind mindestens 50 Menschen getötet worden.
Die Regierung von Libyen hat deshalb den Not-Stand für Tripolis ausgerufen.
Jetzt haben sich die verfeindeten Gruppen auf eine Waffen-Ruhe geeinigt.
Bei den Verhandlungen darüber hat ein Mann von den Vereinten Nationen geholfen.
Aber ob die Waffen-Ruhe wirklich hält, weiß niemand.
Merkel will aufhören
Angela Merkel will nicht mehr Chefin von der Partei CDU sein.
Etwas später will sie auch als Bundes-Kanzlerin von Deutschland aufhören.
Merkel ist die wichtigste Politikerin in Deutschland.
Die CDU hat in letzter Zeit bei Wahlen nicht mehr so viele Stimmen bekommen wie früher.
Jetzt hat Merkel gesagt: Es muss sich etwas ändern.
Sie will nicht mehr Chefin von der CDU sein.
Im Dezember soll Schluss sein.
Merkel hat auch gesagt: ich will nur noch 3 Jahre Kanzlerin sein.
Danach will sie gar nicht mehr Politikerin sein.
Die meisten Politiker finden die Entscheidung gut.
Andere Politiker finden: Merkel soll direkt auch als Bundes-Kanzlerin aufhören.
In Deutschland und in anderen Ländern haben viele Menschen Merkel gelobt.
Sie finden, Merkel hat ihre Arbeit viele Jahre lang gut gemacht.
Andere Menschen sagen aber auch: Es ist Zeit für etwas Neues.
Merkel ist 64 Jahre alt.
Sie ist schon 18 Jahre Chefin von der Partei CDU.
Sie ist seit 13 Jahren Bundes-Kanzlerin.
Diesel-Skandal
Der Auto-Hersteller Daimler muss in Deutschland 238000 Diesel-Autos zurückrufen.
Der Grund: Daimler soll bei den Abgas-Werten von den Diesel-Motoren betrogen haben.
Das Bundes-Verkehrs-Ministerium hat deshalb entschieden, dass Daimler die Autos zurück-rufen muss.
Daimler muss nun die Computer-Programme von den Diesel-Motoren ändern.
Betroffen von dem Rück-Ruf sind auch Modelle von der C-Klasse und Gelände-Wagen.
Auch andere Auto-Hersteller in Deutschland sind von dem Diesel-Skandal betroffen.
VW muss deshalb jetzt eine Strafe von einer Milliarde Euro zahlen.
Das hat die Staats-Anwaltschaft Braunschweig entschieden.
Der Auto-Hersteller Audi soll auch bei den Diesel-Motoren geschummelt haben.
Deshalb ermittelt die Staats-Anwaltschaft München gegen den Chef von Audi.
Er heißt Rupert Stadler.
Auch gegen andere Audi-Manager wird ermittelt.
Terror-Anschlag
In dem Land Frankreich hat es wahrscheinlich einen Terror-Anschlag gegeben.
Ein Mann hat drei Menschen getötet.
Der Mann hat zuerst in der Stadt Carcassonne einen Menschen getötet.
Und er hat auf Polizisten geschossen.
Dann ist der Mann in den Ort Trèbes gefahren.
Dort hat er in einem Super-Markt zwei Menschen getötet.
Er war ein paar Stunden in dem Super-Markt.
Die Menschen durften nicht gehen.
Dann hat die Polizei gesagt: Wir stürmen den Super-Markt.
Sie haben den Mann erschossen.
Der Präsident von Frankreich heißt Emmanuel Macron.
Er sagt: Das war ein Terror-Anschlag.
Die Terror-Miliz IS sagt: Der Täter war ein Mitglied von uns.
Der Täter war 26 Jahre alt.
Die Polizei hat ihn schon vorher beobachtet.
Er hat vorher schon verbotene Dinge gemacht.
Aber die Polizei hat nicht gedacht, dass er ein Terrorist ist.
Für diesen Beitrag gibt es leider kein Audio.
Neujahrs-Ansprache
Bundes-Kanzlerin Merkel hat zum Jahres-Wechsel eine Rede gehalten.
Die Rede heißt auch: Neujahrs-Ansprache.
Merkel hat gesagt: Die Länder müssen zusammen-arbeiten, wenn sie große Probleme lösen wollen.
Merkel hat 3 Themen genannt, die sie dabei besonders wichtig findet:
den Klima-Wandel, die Migration und den Terrorismus.
Sie hat gesagt: Wenn Länder zusammenarbeiten, ist das auch besser für jedes einzelne Land.
Merkel hat auch über Streit zwischen Parteien und Politikern gesprochen.
Sie hat gesagt: Viele Menschen in Deutschland haben sich deshalb über die Bundes-Regierung geärgert.
Merkel hat auch gesagt: 2018 war ein schwieriges Jahr.
Die Menschen in Deutschland konnten die Neujahrs-Ansprache im Radio hören oder im Fernsehen anschauen.
Wahl in Hessen
Das Bundes-Land Hessen bekommt eine neue Regierung.
Die Menschen haben einen neuen Land-Tag gewählt.
Die Partei CDU hat zwar die meisten Stimmen bekommen.
Sie hat aber im Vergleich zur letzten Wahl viele Stimmen verloren.
Auch die Partei SPD hat viele Stimmen verloren.
Die Partei Die Grünen hat viele Stimmen gewonnen.
Die Partei AfD kommt zum ersten Mal in den Land-Tag in Hessen.
Auch die Parteien FDP und Die Linke sind im neuen Land-Tag.
Bisher regieren in Hessen CDU und Grüne zusammen.
Der Regierungs-Chef von Hessen heißt Volker Bouffier.
Er ist Chef von der CDU in Hessen.
Er hat schon mit Politikern von den Grünen über eine neue Koalition gesprochen.
Nach der Hessen-Wahl hat Bundes-Kanzlerin Angela Merkel gesagt: Ich will nicht länger Chefin von der CDU sein.
Neuer Job für Gabriel
Sigmar Gabriel war in Deutschland Wirtschafts- und Außen-Minister.
Jetzt soll er einen neuen Job bei einem großen Unternehmen bekommen.
Der Opposition gefällt das nicht.
Sigmar Gabriel bekommt einen Job bei dem geplanten Konzern Siemens-Alstom.
Er wird Mitglied im Verwaltungs-Rat.
Das Unternehmen Siemens und Alstom aus dem Land Frankreich werden zusammen Züge bauen.
Die Parteien Die Linke und Die Grünen sind empört.
Sie sagen: Gabriel hat als Wirtschafts-Minister den Zusammen-Schluss von Siemens und Alstom unterstützt.
Jetzt profitiert er davon.
Das darf nicht sein.
Gabriel sagt: Ich halte mich an alle Gesetze und ich habe die Bundes-Regierung informiert.
In Deutschland müssen ehemalige Mitglieder von der Regierung ein Jahr lang warten, ehe sie eine Arbeits-Stelle in der Wirtschaft antreten.
Die Organisation Lobbycontrol sagt: Das ist zu kurz.
Große Hitze
In Deutschland und in vielen anderen Ländern ist es zur Zeit sehr heiß.
Viele Menschen leiden unter der Hitze, besonders ältere und kranke Menschen.
Und auf den Feldern vertrocknen viele Pflanzen.
Auch das Wasser in den Flüssen ist wärmer als sonst.
Für viele Fisch-Arten ist das gefährlich.
Wenn es zu warm wird, sterben die Fische.
Manche Atom-Kraft-Werke dürfen jetzt nicht mehr mit voller Kraft laufen.
Denn sie benutzen Wasser aus den Flüssen zum Kühlen.
Durch die Wärme aus den Kraft-Werken wird das Wasser dann noch wärmer.
Für manche Firmen ist die Hitze gut.
Eis-Hersteller verdienen zum Beispiel viel mehr Geld als in kälteren Sommern.
Und auch Getränke-Hersteller können in diesem Jahr besonders viel verkaufen.
Außerdem regnet es viel zu wenig.
Viele Bauern haben deshalb große Probleme.
Sie ernten weniger als sonst.
Denn die Pflanzen bekommen nicht genug Wasser.
Zum Ausgleich wollen die Bauern Geld vom Staat.
Die Bundes-Regierung hat darüber noch nicht entschieden.
Macron in den USA
Der Präsident von dem Land Frankreich heißt Emmanuel Macron.
Er ist für drei Tage in das Land USA gereist.
Dort hat er sich mit Präsident Donald Trump getroffen.
Emmanuel Macron und Donald Trump haben zum Beispiel über das Land Iran geredet.
Mit dem Iran gibt es einen Vertrag.
Darin steht: Der Iran darf keine Atom-Waffen herstellen.
Dafür verzichten die anderen Länder auf Strafen.
Trump findet den Vertrag schlecht.
Er will, dass die USA dabei nicht mehr mitmachen.
Macron ist für den Vertrag.
Er hat bei dem Besuch aber gesagt: Vielleicht könnte es einen neueren und besseren Vertrag geben.
Der Präsident von dem Land Iran heißt Hassan Rohani.
Er hat gesagt, dass der Iran den Vertrag nicht ändern möchte.
Der französische Präsident Macron hat bei seinem Besuch auch eine Rede im Kongress von den USA gehalten.
Er hat gesagt: Die Länder in der Welt sollen eng zusammen arbeiten.
Macron hat damit auf Trump reagiert.
Der hat immer wieder gesagt: Ich kümmere mich zuerst um die USA.
Mir ist vor allem wichtig, dass es meinem Land gut geht.
Der Besuch war ein Staats-Besuch.
Das bedeutet: Er war sehr feierlich.
Es wurden viele Fotos für die Presse gemacht.
Die beiden Politiker haben zum Beispiel gemeinsam einen Baum gepflanzt.
Macron hat auf die Reise auch seine Ehe-Frau mitgenommen.
Mehr zu dem Atom-Abkommen mit dem Iran können Sie hier lesen.
Trump trifft Kim
Zum ersten Mal haben sich die Staats-Chefs von den Ländern USA und Nord-Korea getroffen.
Sie heißen Donald Trump und Kim Jong Un.
Bei dem Treffen haben sie eine wichtige Erklärung unterschrieben.
Das Treffen war in dem Land Singapur in Asien.
Kim hat gesagt: Nordkorea will alle Atom-Waffen abschaffen.
Trump hat erklärt: Die USA wollen erst mal die gemeinsamen Sicherheits-Militär-Übungen mit Süd-Korea stoppen.
Beide Politiker haben aber nicht genau gesagt, wie sie das machen wollen.
Politiker und Experten sagen: Das ist ein erster wichtiger Schritt für den Frieden.
Viele glauben aber auch, dass der Streit zwischen Nord-Korea und den USA vielleicht weiter-geht.
Denn Nord-Korea hatte schon früher versprochen, die Atom-Waffen abzuschaffen.
Auch Trump hat sich nicht immer an seine Versprechen gehalten.
Zwischen Nord-Korea und den USA gibt es seit vielen Jahren Streit.
In dem Streit geht es vor allem um gefährliche Atom-Waffen, die Nord-Korea wahrscheinlich besitzt.
Mit diesen Atom-Waffen hat NordKorea den USA und anderen Ländern gedroht.
Auch andere Länder haben mit Nord-Korea immer wieder Streit.
Sie wollen nicht, dass Nord-Korea Atom-Versuche macht.
Die Regierung hatte deshalb angekündigt: Die Atom-Versuche werden gestoppt.
Jetzt hat die Regierung sogar eine Anlage für Atom-Versuche gesprengt.
Geheimer Besuch
Der Diktator von Nord-Korea hat das Land China besucht.
Er heißt Kim Jong Un.
Der Besuch war geheim.
Es ist etwas Besonderes, dass Kim ein anderes Land besucht.
Denn Nord-Korea hat mit fast allen Ländern Streit.
Kim ist mit einem Zug in die chinesische Haupt-Stadt Peking gefahren.
Nord-Korea und China sind Nachbar-Länder.
In Peking hat er den Staats-Chef von China getroffen.
Er heißt Xi Jinping.
Am nächsten Tag ist Kim wieder zurück nach Nord-Korea gefahren.
Der Besuch ist etwas Besonderes.
Nord-Korea und China haben zwar Beziehungen zueinander.
Aber Nord-Korea hat viele Geheimnisse.
Viele Länder glauben: Nord-Korea hat Atom-Waffen.
In den letzten Wochen hat es aber Zeichen gegeben, dass Nord-Korea wieder mit anderen Ländern reden will.
Es soll zum Beispiel ein Treffen zwischen dem Diktator Kim Jong Un und dem Präsidenten von Süd-Korea geben.
Beide Länder haben seit Langem Streit.
Außerdem soll es ein Treffen mit dem Präsidenten von den USA geben.
Bei den Treffen soll es vor allem um das Atom-Programm von Nord-Korea gehen.
Das Land hat in der Vergangenheit oft Raketen getestet.
Damit wollte das Land anderen Ländern drohen.
Denn die Raketen könnten auch Atom-Waffen tragen.
Die Vereinten Nationen haben Nord-Korea solche Tests verboten.
Streit um Minister
In der SPD hat es Streit darüber gegeben, wer Minister werden soll.
Dabei gab es viel Kritik an Martin Schulz.
Er ist Vorsitzender von der SPD.
Martin Schulz hatte vor und nach der Bundestagswahl gesagt: Ich will kein Minister werden, wenn Angela Merkel noch einmal Bundeskanzlerin wird.
Nach den Koalitionsverhandlungen hat er gesagt: Ich will Außenminister werden.
Jetzt hat er bekannt gegeben: Ich werde doch nicht Minister.
In der SPD gab es viel Kritik an Martin Schulz.
Viele Leute aus der Partei haben gesagt: Schulz hat sein Versprechen gebrochen.
Sigmar Gabriel hat sich besonders über Schulz geärgert.
Er ist gerade Außenminister.
Schulz soll ihm versprochen haben, dass er in einer neuen Regierung Außenminister bleiben darf.
Dafür sollte Gabriel den Parteivorsitz an Schulz abgeben.
Das hat er auch gemacht.
Schulz ist noch SPD-Vorsitzender.
Am 7. Februar hatte er aber gesagt, dass er das Amt abgeben will, wenn er Minister wird.
Andrea Nahles soll neue SPD-Chefin werden.
Sie ist schon Chefin von den SPD-Abgeordneten im Bundestag.
Schlechte Medizin-Produkte
Die Kontrollen für Medizin-Produkte sind oft nicht gut genug.
Das haben Journalisten herausgefunden.
Medizin-Produkte sind zum Beispiel: Herz-Schritt-Macher oder künstliche Hüft-Gelenke.
Medizin-Produkte sollen kranken Menschen helfen.
Manche von diesen Produkten werden bei einer Operation in den Körper eingebaut.
Man nennt sie " Implantate ".
Die Journalisten haben festgestellt: Die Kontrollen für Implantate sind in Europa nicht gut.
Die Hersteller müssen nicht beweisen, dass die Implantate gut funktionieren und sicher sind.
Deshalb kann es passieren, dass die Implantate im Körper kaputt gehen.
Dann braucht der kranke Mensch noch eine Operation.
Manche Politiker sagen jetzt: Es muss strengere Kontrollen geben.
Dafür muss man in Europa die Gesetze ändern.
Andere Politiker sagen aber: Die Fehler sind Ausnahmen.
Eigentlich funktionieren die Kontrollen gut.
Und strengere Kontrollen sind zu kompliziert für die Hersteller.
Zurück nach Belgien
Der katalanische Politiker Carles Puigdemont bleibt nicht in Deutschland.
Er geht zurück in das Land Belgien.
Puigdemont musste 4 Monate in Deutschland bleiben.
Die deutsche Polizei hatte Puigdemont im März festgenommen.
Es hat einen Haft-Befehl aus dem Land Spanien gegeben.
Puigdemont hat Streit mit der Regierung.
Der Politiker will, dass die Region Katalonien unabhängig von Spanien wird.
Für Spanien ist das eine Rebellion.
Die deutschen Behörden haben aber gesagt: Das ist für uns keine Rebellion.
Ein spanisches Gericht hat danach entschieden: Der Haft-Befehl gilt nicht mehr.
Deshalb darf Puigdemont auch raus aus Deutschland.
Jetzt geht er nach Belgien.
Dort war er schon, bevor ihn die Polizei in Deutschland festgenommen hat.
Puigdemont sagt: In der Haupt-Stadt Brüssel werde ich weiter kämpfen für Katalonien.

Mehr Lohn
Erzieher, Bus-Fahrer und Angestellte in Ämtern bekommen mehr Geld.
Die Arbeit-Geber und die Gewerkschaften haben verhandelt.
Am Ende haben sie einen neuen Tarif-Vertrag vereinbart.
Der Vertrag gilt für den öffentlichen Dienst in Städten, Gemeinden und im Bund.
In dem Vertrag gibt es 3 Lohn-Erhöhungen.
In diesem Jahr steigen die Löhne um ungefähr 3 Prozent.
Das bedeutet: Ein Müll-Arbeiter bekommt zum Beispiel ungefähr 90 Euro mehr.
Im nächsten Jahr gibt es dann noch einmal eine Erhöhung um 3 Prozent.
Und ein Jahr später steigen die Löhne dann noch einmal um 1 Prozent.
Die Gewerkschaften wollten eigentlich mehr erreichen:
Sie wollten, dass die Löhne gleich in diesem Jahr um 6 Prozent steigen.
Und sie wollten, dass jeder mindestens 200 Euro mehr bekommt.
Dafür hatten viele Mitarbeiter gestreikt und demonstriert.
Trotzdem sind die Gewerkschafts-Chefs jetzt zufrieden.
Sie sagen: Es ist das beste Ergebnis seit langer Zeit.
Viele Städte sagen aber: Die Löhne steigen zu stark.
Wir wissen nicht, wie wir das bezahlen sollen.
Anschlag noch ungeklärt
In der Stadt Düsseldorf hat es vor 18 Jahren einen Bomben-Anschlag gegeben.
10 Menschen wurden verletzt.
Noch immer steht nicht fest, wer die Bombe gezündet hat.
Es gab ein Gerichts-Verfahren, aber der Angeklagte wurde freigesprochen.
In dem Prozess ging es um einen 52 Jahre alten Mann.
Er wurde verdächtigt, die Bombe gelegt zu haben.
Aber die Beweise waren nicht eindeutig.
Die Staats-Anwaltschaft ist mit dem Frei-Spruch nicht einverstanden.
Sie hält den Mann immer noch für schuldig.
Sie sagt: Der Mann wollte viele Menschen töten.
Er hat aus Fremden-Hass gehandelt.
Jetzt muss sich ein höheres Gericht noch einmal mit dem Anschlag befassen.
Die Opfer waren Sprach-Schüler.
Die meisten von ihnen waren Juden aus Ost-Europa.
10 von ihnen wurden bei dem Anschlag verletzt.
Eine Frau war schwanger.
Ihr ungeborenes Kind ist durch den Anschlag gestorben.
Der Anschlag war an einer S-Bahn-Haltestelle.
Die Haltestelle heißt Düsseldorf-Wehrhahn.
Deshalb wird der Anschlag auch " Wehrhahn-Anschlag " genannt.
Diskussion um Migration
In vielen UNO-Ländern wird derzeit über einen Text zur Migration gestritten:
den UNO-Migrations-Pakt.
Den Text haben die Länder von der UNO gemeinsam ausgehandelt.
Einige Länder finden ihn jetzt aber schlecht.
Eigentlich haben sich alle 193 UNO-Länder vor 2 Jahren auf den Text geeinigt.
Darin stehen Vorschläge zum Thema Flucht und Migration.
Ein Ziel ist, dass niemand aus Verzweiflung sein Heimat-Land verlassen muss.
Es geht in dem Text aber auch darum, wie man Migranten und Flüchtlinge schützen kann und welche Rechte sie haben.
Der Text ist aber kein Gesetz.
Die Länder müssen sich nicht daran halten.
Eigentlich sollte der Text im Dezember von allen UNO-Ländern unterschrieben werden.
Jetzt sagen aber einige Länder: Wir wollen den Migrations-Text nicht mehr.
Das sind zum Beispiel Österreich und die USA.
Sie finden: In dem Text geht es zu sehr um die Rechte von den Migranten und zu wenig um die Rechte von den Ziel-Ländern.
Sie glauben, dass dann noch mehr Menschen ihre Heimat-Länder verlassen.
Die Probleme von Migration werden nicht angesprochen.
Auch in Deutschland wird über den UNO-Migrations-Pakt gestritten.
Einige Politiker finden: Die Menschen in Deutschland wissen nicht genug über den Text.
Wir sollten alle noch mehr darüber diskutieren.
Bundes-Kanzlerin Angela Merkel hat darum mehrfach betont: Der Pakt ist gut für Deutschland.
Für unser Land ist es wichtig, dass die Migration besser kontrolliert und geregelt wird.
Konferenz von Junger Union
Die Junge Union ist die Nachwuchs-Organisation der Parteien CDU und CSU.
Die Junge Union hat sich auf einer großen Konferenz in der Stadt Kiel getroffen.
Dabei hat sie über wichtige Themen gesprochen.
An der Konferenz haben etwa 1000 Mitglieder von der Jungen Union teilgenommen.
Auch Bundes-Kanzlerin Angela Merkel hat dort gesprochen.
Merkel ist die Vorsitzende der CDU.
Bei der Konferenz ging es auch um die Politik von der Bundes-Regierung.
Viele Mitglieder von der Jungen Union kritisieren: Die Bundes-Regierung tut zu wenig und streitet zu viel.
Es müssen mehr jüngere Menschen Politik machen.
Außerdem soll die Politik sich wieder mehr um Themen kümmern, die die Menschen interessieren:
zum Beispiel die Pflege, die Rente und die Miet-Preise.
Bundes-Kanzlerin Merkel hat die Kritik zurückgewiesen.
Sie sagt: Wir arbeiten viel für die Menschen.
Rassismus in Deutschland
Im Internet berichten gerade viele Menschen über ihre Erfahrungen mit Rassismus.
Die meisten von ihnen haben einen Migrations-Hintergrund.
Das heißt: Ihre Eltern oder Großeltern sind aus einem anderen Land nach Deutschland gekommen.
Einige Deutsche grenzen sie allein deshalb aus.
Das nennt man auch Rassismus.
Die Menschen erzählen zum Beispiel: Lehrer in der Schule haben uns schlechtere Noten gegeben, nur weil wir einen Migrations-Hintergrund haben.
Andere erzählen: Wir finden keine Arbeits-Stelle oder keine Wohnung.
Wenn diese Menschen von ihren Erlebnissen berichten, schreiben sie immer ein Stichwort dazu.
Dieses heißt: " MeTwo ".
Das sind 2 Wörter auf Englisch.
Sie bedeuten " ich " und " zwei ".
Menschen mit Migrations-Hintergrund wollen damit sagen: Wir fühlen uns mit Deutschland und mit dem Land unserer Vorfahren verbunden.
Wir haben 2 Identitäten.
Zu dem Stich-Wort fügen sie einen Hashtag hinzu.
Hashtag ist der englische Name für das Raute-Zeichen.
Dieses Zeichen besteht aus zwei senkrechten Strichen, die von zwei waagerechten Strichen gekreuzt werden.
Zu der Debatte sagt man deshalb auch: # MeTwo-Debatte.
Ausgelöst hat die Debatte der ehemalige deutsche Fußball-National-Spieler Mesut Özil.
Weitere Informationen dazu finden Sie hier und hier.
Warn-Streiks
In Deutschland haben zehntausende Mitarbeiter von Metall-Betrieben in dieser Woche weniger gearbeitet.
Die Gewerkschaft IG Metall hat zu Warn-Streiks aufgerufen.
Sie will erreichen, dass die Mitarbeiter nur noch 28 Stunden pro Woche arbeiten.
Dabei sollen sie aber nicht viel weniger verdienen als bisher.
Dagegen wehren sich die Arbeitgeber.
In Deutschland arbeiten fast 4 Millionen Menschen in Metall-Betrieben.
Viele von ihnen arbeiten auch früh morgens, spät abends oder nachts.
Die meisten haben Kinder und wollen sich mehr um sie kümmern.
Deswegen sollen sie Teil-Zeit arbeiten können, ohne auf ihren vollen Lohn zu verzichten.
Das will die Gewerkschaft.
Die Arbeitgeber finden die Idee nicht gut.
Sie meinen: Die Firmen schaffen die Arbeit nicht mehr, wenn viele Arbeiter weniger Stunden arbeiten.
Der Vorschlag ist ihrer Ansicht nach auch ungerecht.
Schon jetzt arbeiten viele in Teil-Zeit, bekommen aber auch weniger Geld.
Genau das soll sich ändern.
Die Gewerkschaft will ihren Vorschlag durchsetzen.
Sie droht den Arbeitgebern.
Bald soll es einen ganzen Tag und eine ganze Nacht lang einen Warn-Streik geben.
Und wenn das nicht hilft, auch ein paar Tage oder Monate lang.
Brasilien:
neuer Präsident
Die Menschen in dem Land Brasilien haben einen neuen Präsidenten gewählt.
Er heißt Jair Bolsonaro.
Er ist rechts-extrem.
Bolsonaro hat im Wahl-Kampf gesagt: Ich will hart gegen meine Feinde und gegen Verbrecher vorgehen.
Er will sie zum Beispiel foltern und auch töten lassen.
In Brasilien gibt es viele Verbrechen und Korruption.
Viele Menschen haben gehofft, dass das mit Bolsonaro weniger wird.
Deshalb haben sie ihn gewählt.
Denn er hat gesagt: Ich kümmere mich um die Sicherheit und kämpfe gegen Korruption.
Bolsonaro hat auch schlecht über Frauen, Schwule und Flüchtlinge gesprochen.
Deshalb haben viele Menschen in Braslien jetzt Angst.
Sie denken: In Brasilien gibt es bald keine Demokratie mehr.
SPD für Koalitions-Gespräche
Die Partei SPD ist für Koalitions-Gespräche mit den Parteien CDU und CSU bereit.
Es gab extra einen Partei-Tag.
Und der hat dafür gestimmt.
Die Entscheidung bei dem Treffen in der Stadt Bonn ist knapp gewesen.
Viele in der SPD sind gegen eine neue Koalition mit CDU und CSU - vor allem die jungen Mitglieder.
Sie nennen sich Jusos.
Und Sie wollen lieber nicht regieren.
Eine neue Koalition mit CDU und CSU ist aber noch nicht sicher.
Die SPD will in den Gesprächen mit CDU und CSU einige wichtige Themen neu verhandeln.
Danach dürfen die SPD-Mitglieder noch einmal abstimmen.
Nur wenn eine Mehrheit dann Ja sagt, gibt es eine neue Koalition von CDU, CSU und SPD.
Die nennt man auch Große Koalition.
Die Jusos haben eine Aktion gestartet:
Wer gegen die Koalition ist, soll jetzt in die SPD eintreten.
Sie wollen eine Mehrheit für ein Nein bei der Abstimmung.
Weber kandidiert
Manfred Weber ist ein deutscher EU-Politiker.
Er möchte jetzt das wichtigste Amt in der EU:
Er will Kommissions-Präsident werden.
Manfred Weber kommt aus dem Bundes-Land Bayern.
Er ist in der Partei CSU.
Seit dem Jahr 2004 ist er Abgeordneter im Europäischen Parlament.
Dort ist er der Vorsitzende von der EVP-Fraktion.
In der EVP haben sich konservative Parteien aus ganz Europa zusammengeschlossen.
Im nächsten Jahr wird im Mai wieder das Europäische Parlament gewählt.
Weber hat jetzt gesagt: Ich möchte der Spitzen-Kandidat von der EVP werden.
Die deutsche Bundes-Kanzlerin Angela Merkel findet das gut.
Diese Entscheidung ist wichtig.
Der Spitzen-Kandidat von der Sieger-Partei wird nämlich normalerweise als neuer Präsident von der Europäischen Kommission vorgeschlagen.
Bei den letzten Europa-Wahlen hat die EVP immer gewonnen.
Im Moment ist Jean-Claude Juncker aus dem Land Luxemburg der Kommissions-Präsident.
Flüchtlinge in Afrin
Die Armee von dem Land Türkei hat eine Region in Nord-Syrien erobert.
Viele Tausend Menschen aus Afrin sind auf der Flucht.
Die Menschen haben keinen Schutz und brauchen Zelte und Decken.
Frauen bringen ihre Babys am Straßenrand zur Welt.
Reporter berichten aus Afrin, dass Diebe aus Restaurants, Geschäften und Häusern alles stehlen.
Soldaten und Rebellen töten Menschen auf der Straße.
Das Rote Kreuz fordert, dass es den Flüchtlingen helfen darf.
Die Türkei hat vor zwei Monaten Soldaten in den Norden von Syrien geschickt.
Sie sollen dort Stütz-Punkte von Kurden angreifen.
Die kurdische Miliz in Syrien heißt YPG.
Sie kontrolliert mehrere Gebiete im Norden, in denen vor allem Kurden wohnen.
Die Türkei sagt: Die Kämpfer von der YPG sind Terroristen.
Und: Die YPG ist eine Schwester-Organisation der verbotenen PKK.
Die PKK will eine Unabhängigkeit für die Kurden in der Türkei.
Bundes-Kanzlerin Angela Merkel hat gesagt: Es ist nicht richtig, was die türkische Armee in Afrin macht.
Weihnachts-Ansprachen
In der ganzen Welt haben Christen das Weihnachts-Fest gefeiert.
Der Papst und der deutsche Bundes-Präsident haben Reden gehalten.
Der Bundes-Präsident heißt Frank-Walter Steinmeier.
Er hält jedes Jahr eine Ansprache zu Weihnachten.
In diesem Jahr hat er gesagt: Die Menschen müssen wieder lernen, wie sie miteinander reden und streiten.
Steinmeier sagt: Man muss auch mit Menschen reden, die anderer Meinung sind.
Papst Franziskus hat an Weihnachten in Rom gesprochen.
Er hat gesagt: Die Menschen sollen nicht so gierig sein und immer mehr wollen.
Sie sollen statt dessen mit anderen teilen.
Der Papst gibt jedes Jahr am 1. Weihnachts-Tag einen besonderen Segen.
In lateinischer Sprache sagt er: " Urbi et orbi ".
Das bedeutet: Ich segne die Stadt und die ganze Erde.
Urteil im Stadt-Archiv-Prozess
Vor 9 Jahren ist das Stadt-Archiv in der Stadt Köln eingestürzt.
Jetzt gibt es ein Gerichts-Urteil.
Angeklagt war ein Bau-Kontrolleur von den Verkehrs-Betrieben in Köln.
Er hat eine Haft-Strafe von 8 Monaten auf Bewährung erhalten.
Auf Bewährung heißt: Er muss nicht ins Gefängnis, wenn er bestimmte Regeln beachtet.
Drei andere Menschen wurden frei-gesprochen.
Der Richter hat gesagt: Das Archiv ist eingestürzt, weil es einen schweren Fehler beim Bau von der neuen U-Bahn-Halte-Stelle gegeben hat.
Durch ein Loch in einer Wand unter der Erde ist viel Sand und Wasser in die Bau-Grube gekommen.
Dadurch ist dem Stadt-Archiv der Boden weggebrochen.
Das Stadt-Archiv ist am 3. März 2009 eingestürzt.
Dabei sind zwei Menschen gestorben.
In dem Archiv waren wichtige Akten aus der Kölner Geschichte.
Viele sind zerstört.
Partei-Chefs für Koalitions-Gespräche
Die Parteien CDU, CSU und SPD wollen vielleicht wieder zusammen regieren.
Das haben die Partei-Chefs heute in Berlin gesagt.
Vorher hatten wichtige Politiker von allen drei Parteien eine Woche lang geredet und gestritten.
Sie wollten herausfinden, ob es genug Themen gibt, bei denen sie zusammen Politik machen wollen.
Zum Schluss haben die Politiker aufgeschrieben, wie sie zusammen Politik machen wollen.
Sie wollen zum Beispiel das Kinder-Geld erhöhen.
Bei den Beiträgen für die Kranken-Kasse sollen Arbeit-Geber wieder die eine Hälfte und Arbeit-Nehmer die andere Hälfte zahlen.
Bis jetzt mussten Arbeit-Geber* manchmal weniger zahlen.
Ob CDU, CSU und SPD wirklich wieder zusammen regieren, steht noch nicht fest.
Das liegt vor allem an der SPD.
Dort gibt es Mitglieder, die sagen: Wir finden es nicht gut, wenn unsere Partei nochmal mit CDU und CSU regiert.
Darum gibt es in der SPD noch einen Partei-Tag.
Danach steht dann fest, ob die drei Parteien wirklich über eine Koalition sprechen.
*Wir haben einen Fehler gemacht.
In dem Text stand: Arbeit-Nehmer.
Das war aber falsch.
Richtig ist: Arbeit-Geber.
Der Fehler tut uns leid.
Leider können wir nur den Text ändern.
Wir können das Audio nicht mehr ändern.
Handels-Streit
Das Land USA und die Europäische Union haben Streit um ihren Handel.
Der Präsident von dem Land USA heißt Donald Trump.
Er hat entschieden, dass Unternehmen aus den USA eine Strafe zahlen müssen, wenn sie Waren aus dem Ausland kaufen.
Trump nennt das Straf-Zoll.
Diese Straf-Zölle wird es ab Ende März geben.
Die Zölle gelten vor allem für Aluminium, Stahl und Autos aus dem Ausland.
Die Amerikaner sollen diese Waren nur noch in ihrer Heimat kaufen.
Trump glaubt: Den Firmen in den USA geht es dann besser.
Es gibt dann auch mehr Arbeitsplätze in den USA.
Die EU hat gesagt: Wenn Trump das macht, dann gibt es auch Straf-Zölle für Waren aus den USA.
Die europäischen Straf-Zölle könnte es etwa für Jeans, Erdnuss-Butter oder Motorräder aus den USA geben.
Experten sind sehr besorgt über den Streit.
Sie warnen vor einem Handels-Krieg.
Sie sagen: Dabei werden alle verlieren.
Wohnen kann teurer werden
Deutschland bekommt ein neues Gesetz über die Grund-Steuer.
Diese Steuer müssen Haus-Besitzer und auch Mieter zahlen.
In vielen Städten könnte das Wohnen dadurch teurer werden.
Die Grund-Steuer gibt es schon sehr lange.
Und sie wurde auch sehr lange nicht geändert.
Dagegen haben mehrere Haus-Besitzer geklagt.
Sie sagen: Wir zahlen viel zu viel.
Sie wollten, dass die Steuer neu berechnet wird.
Das Bundes-Verfassungsgericht hat den Haus-Besitzern Recht gegeben.
Die Richter haben entschieden: Die Grund-Steuer ist ungerecht.
Denn sie wird mit ganz veralteten Zahlen berechnet.
Das muss geändert werden.
Noch ist nicht klar, wie die Politiker die Steuer ändern werden.
Für einige Haus-Besitzer wird die Steuer wahrscheinlich niedriger.
Für andere wird es wahrscheinlich teurer, vor allem in großen Städten.
Die Grund-Steuer bezahlt der Haus-Besitzer.
Aber auch Mieter müssen mitbezahlen:
Ein Teil von der Grund-Steuer gehört zu den Neben-Kosten bei der Miete.
Empörung über Gauland
Der AfD-Politiker Alexander Gauland hat mit einer Äußerung zum National-Sozialismus für Empörung gesorgt.
Er hat die Herrschaft der Nazis als " Vogel-Schiss " in der deutschen Geschichte bezeichnet.
Alexander Gauland ist ein Vorsitzender von der AfD-Fraktion im Bundestag.
Er hat bei einem Treffen von der AfD-Jugend eine Rede gehalten.
Darin hat er gesagt, dass die Deutschen eine ruhmreiche Geschichte haben.
Weiter hat er gesagt: Die " dauerte länger als die verdammten 12 Jahre ".
Damit hat Gauland die Zeit des National-Sozialismus gemeint.
Er hat sich zur deutschen Verantwortung für die 12 Jahre bekannt.
Und dann hat er wörtlich gesagt: " Aber Hitler und die Nazis sind nur ein Vogel-Schiss in über tausend Jahren erfolgreicher deutscher Geschichte. "
Für diesen Satz hat Gauland Applaus bekommen.
Viele Menschen haben sich über diesen Satz aufgeregt.
Sie finden: Gauland tut so, als seien die Verbrechen von den Nazis nicht so schlimm gewesen.
Er verhöhnt damit die Opfer.
Der Sprecher von der Bundes-Regierung hat gesagt: Es ist beschämend, dass man sich mit solchen Äußerungen eines Bundestags-Abgeordneten befassen muss.
Auch einige Politiker von der AfD haben sich beschwert:
Sie finden, dass die Partei mit solchen Äußerungen zu rechts-radikal klingt.
Inzwischen gibt es bereits eine Anzeige gegen Gauland wegen Volks-Verhetzung.
Die Leute, die die Talk-Show " Hart aber fair " machen, haben entschieden: Gauland wird nicht mehr als Gast eingeladen.
Gauland selbst hat gesagt: Ich habe das nicht so gemeint.
Das Wort " Vogel-Schiss " bedeutet, dass ich den National-Sozialismus verachte.
Ex-VW-Chef soll in Haft
Martin Winterkorn ist der Chef von dem größten deutschen Auto-Konzern VW gewesen.
In dem Land USA ist jetzt ein Haft-Befehl gegen ihn erlassen worden.
Dieser Haft-Befehl von der amerikanischen Justiz bedeutet: Wenn Winterkorn in die USA kommt, muss die Polizei ihn festnehmen.
Die Justiz sagt: Winterkorn hat betrogen.
Er hat gegen Umwelt-Gesetze verstoßen und die Behörden getäuscht.
Dabei geht es um ein großes Problem.
Man sagt zu diesem Problem auch: Diesel-Skandal oder Abgas-Affäre.
VW hat in Diesel-Autos ein nicht erlaubtes Computer-Programm eingebaut.
Dieses Programm sorgt dafür, dass weniger Abgase aus dem Auspuff kommen.
Das passiert aber nur, wenn das Auto getestet wird.
Es passiert nicht, wenn das Auto normal auf der Straße fährt.
Die Ergebnisse von den Tests besagen dann: Das Auto hält die Gesetze für den Schutz von der Umwelt ein.
In Wahrheit tut es das aber nicht.
Winterkorn soll von diesem Betrug gewusst haben.
Er soll aber nichts dagegen getan haben.
Winterkorn sagt: Das stimmt nicht.
Ich wusste nichts von diesem Betrug.
Austausch von Gefangenen
In dem Konflikt in dem Land Ukraine gibt es eine neue Entwicklung.
Die Aufständischen im Osten und die Armee von der Ukraine haben Gefangene ausgetauscht.
Die Aufständischen haben 73 Menschen freigelassen.
Die Ukraine hat 233 Menschen freigelassen.
Viele Gefangene waren Soldaten.
Der Austausch war schon lange geplant.
Er steht im Vertrag von Minsk.
Das ist ein Friedens-Vertrag.
Minsk ist die Haupt-Stadt von dem Land Weiß-Russland.
Dort haben Politiker über den Vertrag verhandelt.
Der Konflikt um den Osten von der Ukraine dauert schon mehrere Jahre.
Es gibt eigentlich eine Waffen-Ruhe.
Aber trotzdem kämpfen die Aufständischen weiter gegen die Armee von der Regierung.
Die Aufständischen wollen, dass das Kriegs-Gebiet nicht mehr zur Ukraine gehört.
Russland unterstützt die Aufständischen.
Die Regierung von der Ukraine will aber verhindern, dass der Osten ein eigenes Land wird.
Ärger bei Nato-Treffen
Viele wichtige Politiker aus der ganzen Welt sind bei dem Treffen von der Nato gewesen.
Zum Beispiel der Präsident von den USA, Donald Trump.
Auch Bundes-Kanzlerin Angela Merkel war dabei.
Die beiden hatten Streit.
Und Donald Trump hat auch sonst Ärger gemacht.
Die Nato ist ein Bündnis für die Verteidigung.
Die Länder machen zum Beispiel gemeinsame Einsätze mit ihren Soldaten.
Die Länder haben auf dem Treffen in der Stadt Brüssel beschlossen: Wir geben mehr Geld für unser Militär aus.
Das machen wir in den nächsten Jahren.
Donald Trump hat aber gesagt: Das reicht nicht.
Die USA zahlen jetzt schon viel.
Die anderen Länder sollen deshalb sofort mehr Geld geben.
Und sie sollen viel mehr Geld geben, als sie bisher gesagt haben.
Das wollen die anderen Länder aber nicht.
Der Präsident von den USA hat auch Streit gehabt mit Angela Merkel.
Donald Trump hat gesagt: Das Land Russland kontrolliert die Politik in Deutschland.
Und: Deutschland zahlt viel Geld an Russland für Erdgas.
Deshalb ist Deutschland ein Gefangener von Russland.
Angela Merkel hat gesagt: Das stimmt nicht.
Wir entscheiden selbst über unsere Politik.
Donald Trump und Angela Merkel haben deshalb miteinander gesprochen.
Danach hat Donald Trump gesagt: Die USA haben eine gute Beziehung zu Deutschland.
Kein Treffen
Die Staats-Chefs von den Ländern Nord-Korea und USA wollten sich treffen.
Sie heißen Kim Jong Un und Donald Trump.
Jetzt hat aber Donald Trump gesagt: Es gibt erst mal kein Treffen.
Donald Trump hat auch gesagt: Die Regierung von Nord-Korea hat schlecht über uns geredet.
Ich will Kim Jong Un deshalb erst mal nicht treffen,
Donald Trump hat auch gesagt: Vielleicht klappt es aber später.
Die Staats-Chefs sollten sich am 12. Juni treffen.
Die Regierung von Nord-Korea hat in den letzten Tagen die USA kritisiert.
Politiker haben gesagt: Der Vize-Präsident von den USA hat dumme Sachen über uns gesagt.
Die Regierung in Nord-Korea sagt: Wir wollen uns immer noch mit Donald Trump treffen.
Wir finden es traurig, dass er das nicht mehr möchte.
Andere Länder haben mit Nord-Korea immer wieder Streit.
Sie wollen nicht, dass Nord-Korea Atom-Versuche macht.
Die Regierung hat deshalb angekündigt: Wir hören damit auf.
Sie haben jetzt sogar eine Anlage für Atom-Versuche gesprengt.
Nord-Korea hat schon vor einiger Zeit angekündigt, die Anlage kaputt zu machen.
Die Regierung hat auch Journalisten eingeladen.
Sie sollten dabei sein, wenn die Anlage zerstört wird.
Mehrere Reporter sagen: Wir haben eine große Explosion gesehen.
Nord-Korea hat mehrere Tunnel gesprengt.
Darin haben Forscher die Atom-Versuche gemacht.
Jeder 4. bricht Lehre ab
Viele junge Menschen erlernen einen Beruf im Handwerk oder in der Industrie.
Doch jeder 4. Auszubildende beendet seine Lehre nicht.
Das ist der höchste Wert seit Jahren.
Besonders häufig beenden Lehrlinge im Sicherheits-Gewerbe vorzeitig ihre Ausbildung.
Hier ist es jeder 2. Auszubildende, der seinen Vertrag früher beendet.
Besonders viele Abbrecher gibt es auch im Dienstleistungs-Bereich, also: Köche, Restaurant- und Hotel-Fachkräfte, Gebäude-Reiniger oder Gerüst-Bauer.
Der Deutsche Gewerkschafts-Bund vertritt die Interessen der Arbeitnehmer.
Der Gewerkschafts-Bund sagt: Die jungen Menschen müssen viele Überstunden machen und bekommen zu wenig Geld.
Auch gibt es oft Streit mit den Ausbildern im Betrieb.
Die Unternehmer sehen das anders.
Sie sagen: Die jungen Menschen haben falsche Vorstellungen von der Arbeits-Welt.
Sie haben oft auch keine Motivation oder eine schlechte Schul-Ausbildung.
Nicht alle Jugendlichen, die ihre Lehrstelle verlassen, sind anschließend arbeitslos.
Knapp die Hälfte sucht sich einen besseren Job.
Erste Gespräche
Die Länder Nord-Korea und Süd-Korea haben seit Langem Streit miteinander.
Jetzt haben wichtige Politiker von beiden Ländern gesagt: Wir wollen uns Mühe geben, damit wir uns besser verstehen.
Politiker auf der ganzen Welt sind erleichtert.
Der Streit zwischen beiden Ländern ist in den letzten Jahren schlimmer geworden.
Manche Menschen hatten Angst, dass es vielleicht Krieg gibt.
Nord-Korea hat auch immer wieder gesagt: Wir haben Atom-Bomben.
Jetzt haben Politiker aus beiden Ländern zum 1. Mal seit 2 Jahren miteinander gesprochen.
Nach dem Treffen haben sie gesagt: Wir wollen uns überlegen, wie wir in Zukunft miteinander umgehen.
Es geht auch um unser Militär.
Außerdem will Nord-Korea Sportler zu den Olympischen Winter-Spielen schicken.
Die Wett-Kämpfe sind in diesem Jahr in Süd-Korea.
Politiker aus anderen Ländern sind erleichtert.
Der Chef von den Vereinten Nationen heißt Antonio Guterres.
Er hat gesagt: Es ist wichtig, dass beide Länder weiter miteinander reden.
Viele Politiker sagen aber auch: Nord-Korea muss seine Atom-Waffen abschaffen.
Sonst kann es keinen Frieden geben.
Ärger um Botschafter
Der Botschafter von dem Land USA in Deutschland heißt Richard Grenell.
Um ihn gibt es jetzt Ärger.
Er hat in einem Interview umstrittene Dinge gesagt.
Grenell lebt seit Mai in Berlin.
Er soll die Interessen von den USA in Deutschland vertreten.
Jetzt hat Richard Grenell einem Internet-Portal ein Interview gegeben.
Das Portal heißt " Breitbart " und ist politisch sehr rechts.
Grenell hat in dem Interview gesagt: Es ist eine spannende Zeit, um in Europa zu leben.
Denn überall in Europa werden die konservativen Parteien und Gruppierungen stärker.
Grenell hat gesagt, dass er die Anführer von den konservativen Gruppen unterstützen will.
Und er hat gesagt, dass die Politik von den linken Parteien falsch war.
Außerdem hat Grenell Sebastian Kurz gelobt.
Kurz ist der Kanzler von dem Land Österreich.
Er ist auch sehr konservativ.
Politiker von der Opposition in den USA haben sich über diese Äußerungen aufgeregt.
Sie sagen: Ein Botschafter soll sich nicht für eine Partei engagieren.
Er soll neutral sein.
In Deutschland haben sich die Politiker noch mehr geärgert.
Sie finden: Grenell soll sich nicht in deutsche Politik einmischen.
Auch konservative deutsche Politiker haben Grenell deshalb kritisiert.
Grenell hat inzwischen gesagt: Ich will mit allen Parteien zusammenarbeiten.
Krise in Peru
In dem Land Peru gibt es eine politische Krise.
Der Präsident heißt Pedro Pablo Kuczynski.
Er hat einen früheren Präsidenten von dem Land begnadigt.
Das finden viele Menschen in Peru falsch.
Der frühere Präsident heißt Alberto Fujimori.
Er war von 1990 bis 2000 Präsident von Peru.
Später hat ein Gericht ihn zu 25 Jahren Gefängnis verurteilt.
Die Richter haben gesagt: Fujimori war brutal und korrupt, und er hat gegen die Menschen-Rechte verstoßen.
Doch der aktuelle Präsident von Peru hat gesagt: Fujimori ist schwer krank.
Darum soll er aus dem Gefängnis kommen.
Die Entscheidung hat viele Menschen wütend gemacht.
Es gab viele Proteste auf den Straßen.
Die Demonstranten sagen: Fujimori darf nicht frei sein, denn er war ein schlimmer Verbrecher.
Einige Minister aus der Regierung sind sogar zurückgetreten.
Holocaust-Gesetz in Polen
Das Land Polen bekommt ein neues Gesetz.
Es verbietet einige Sachen, die mit dem Mord an Juden in der Nazi-Zeit zu tun haben.
In dem Gesetz geht es um die Vernichtungs-Lager der Nazis in Polen, so wie das Lager Auschwitz.
Dort haben die Nazis sehr viele Menschen ermordet, die meisten waren Juden.
Das Land Polen hat nun verboten, dass man " polnische Todes-Lager " sagt.
Denn viele Politiker sagen: Unser Land hat mit den Lagern von den Nazis gar nichts zu tun.
Das neue Gesetz verbietet noch etwas:
Man darf auch nicht mehr sagen, dass Polen den Nazis bei ihren Verbrechen geholfen hat.
Politiker in dem Land Israel finden das Gesetz falsch.
Sie sagen: Das Gesetz verbietet es den Menschen, ihre Meinung frei zu sagen.
Und es verschweigt, dass polnische Bürger den Nazis geholfen haben.
Auch die USA haben das Gesetz kritisiert.
Viele Brände
In Deutschland und Europa gibt es zur Zeit viele Brände.
Ein Grund dafür ist die Trockenheit:
Es hat sehr lange nicht geregnet.
Ein großer Brand war in der Stadt Siegburg.
Das ist in der Nähe von Köln.
Erst hat das Gebüsch neben einer Bahn-Strecke gebrannt.
Dann haben daneben ganz schnell mehrere Häuser angefangen zu brennen.
Mehr als 30 Menschen sind verletzt worden.
Die Bahn-Strecke von Köln nach Frankfurt am Main war lange gesperrt.
Bundes-Kanzlerin Merkel hat den Verletzten gute Besserung gewünscht.
Warum es in Siegburg gebrannt hat, steht noch nicht fest.
Auch in Süd-Deutschland hat es einen großen Brand gegeben.
Am Königs-See bei der Stadt Berchtesgaden hat ein Wald gebrannt.
Dort ist es bergig.
Deshalb war es für die Feuer-Wehr sehr schwierig, den Brand zu löschen.
Auch in Süd-Europa gibt es viele Wald-Brände.
Am schlimmsten ist es in dem Land Portugal.
Hacker-Angriff auf Regierung
Hacker haben das Computer-System von der Bundes-Regierung angegriffen.
Hacker sind Computer-Experten.
Sie haben das Außen-Ministerium und das Verteidigungs-Ministerium angegriffen.
Es ist noch nicht bekannt, wer hinter den Angriffen steckt.
Es gibt Vermutungen, dass es Hacker aus Russland waren.
Das Innen-Ministerium sagt: Der Angriff ist unter Kontrolle.
Wir versuchen, den Fall aufzuklären.
Es ist noch nicht klar, ob es bei dem Angriff Schäden gegeben hat und ob geheime Informationen gestohlen wurden.
Weltweit gibt es immer mehr Angriffe auf Computer-Systeme.
Es gibt auch Angriffe auf die Computer von Firmen und einzelnen Menschen.
Mit gestohlenen Daten können Kriminelle großen Schaden anrichten.
Sie können zum Beispiel Geld von Bank-Konten stehlen.
Oder sie geheime Sicherheits-Informationen über ein Land stehlen.
Aids-Konferenz
In der Stadt Amsterdam in den Niederlanden hat es eine wichtige Konferenz gegeben – die Welt-Aids-Konferenz.
Dort haben 15000 Experten darüber beraten, wie man die Krankheit besser bekämpfen kann.
Aids ist eine Krankheit.
Man kann sie bekommen, wenn man sich mit dem HI-Virus angesteckt hat.
Das Virus wird zum Beispiel beim Sex übertragen.
Es gibt immer bessere Medikamente gegen Aids.
Deshalb sterben immer weniger Menschen an der Krankheit.
Im Jahr 2017 sind 940000 Menschen gestorben.
Vor 10 Jahren waren es noch doppelt so viele.
In den meisten Regionen auf der Welt stecken sich auch immer weniger Leute mit dem HI-Virus an.
Die Fach-Leute haben aber auch gewarnt: Im Osten von Europa und in Zentral-Asien stecken sich immer mehr Menschen an.
Besonders schlimm ist die Situation in Russland.
Die Experten fordern von den Politikern, dass alle Betroffenen Medikamente gegen Aids bekommen.
Und sie fordern, dass die Menschen mehr darüber erfahren, wie sie sich gegen eine Ansteckung schützen können.
Präsident von Kuba
Das Land Kuba hat einen neuen Präsidenten.
Er heißt Miguel Diaz-Canel.
Er ist der Nachfolger von Raul Castro.
Castro war 10 Jahre lang Präsident von Kuba.
Das Parlament in der Haupt-Stadt Havanna hat Miguel Diaz-Canel gewählt.
Andere Kandidaten hat es nicht gegeben.
Diaz-Canel ist 57 Jahre alt.
Sein Vorgänger Castro ist 86 Jahre alt.
Er hatte schon vor 5 Jahren gesagt, dass er nach dieser Amts-Zeit aufhören will.
Diaz-Canel gehört zur Kommunistischen Partei.
Diese Partei regiert Kuba schon seit fast 60 Jahren.
Die meiste Zeit war Fidel Castro Präsident.
Er ist vor 2 Jahren gestorben.
Eine wichtige Aufgabe für den neuen Präsidenten ist, etwas gegen die Wirtschafts-Krise in Kuba zu tun.
Und er muss sich um die Beziehungen zum Nachbar-Land USA kümmern.
Kuba und die USA waren lange Zeit Feinde.
Unter dem US-Präsidenten Barack Obama wurden die Beziehungen etwas besser.
Aber unter dem jetzigen Präsidenten Donald Trump ist es wieder schwieriger geworden.
Konzert gegen Rechts
Nach den Demonstrationen in Chemnitz hat es dort ein Konzert gegen Rechts gegeben.
Außerdem streiten die Menschen darüber, ob es in der Stadt wirklich zu Hetz-Jagden gegen Ausländer gekommen ist.
In Chemnitz hat es in den vergangenen Tagen viele Demonstrationen gegeben.
Daran haben auch Neo-Nazis und Hooligans aus ganz Deutschland teilgenommen.
Der Auslöser war der Tod von einem 35-jährigen Mann.
Er ist auf dem Stadt-Fest erstochen worden.
Die Täter sollen Flüchtlinge aus Syrien und dem Irak sein.
Bei den Demonstrationen wurden deshalb auch ausländer-feindliche Sprüche gebrüllt.
Viele Menschen in ganz Deutschland sind entsetzt gewesen, als sie die vielen Rechts-Radikalen gesehen haben.
Die Musik-Gruppe " Die Toten Hosen " hat mit anderen Musikern ein Konzert gegen Rechts in Chemnitz organisiert.
Das Motto war " Wir sind mehr ".
Es sind 65000 Menschen gekommen.
Chemnitz ist in dem Bundes-Land Sachsen.
Der Regierungs-Chef von Sachsen heißt Michael Kretschmer.
Er hat gesagt: Sachsen hat ein großes Problem mit den Rechts-Radikalen.
Er hat aber auch gesagt: Es hat in Chemnitz keine Hetz-Jagden gegeben.
Seitdem streiten sich Politiker und Bürger darüber, ob in Chemnitz wirklich Ausländer gejagt worden sind.
Der Bundes-Innen-Minister von Deutschland ist Horst Seehofer von der Partei CSU.
Er soll vor anderen Partei-Mitgliedern gesagt haben: Er versteht, wenn die Menschen empört sind über das Verbrechen.
Und wenn sie dann demonstrieren.
Das macht sie nicht zu Nazis.
Dasselbe haben auch Politiker von der Partei AfD gesagt.
Die AfD hat in Chemnitz einen sogenannten " Trauer-Marsch " organisiert.
Daran haben auch Anhänger von dem ausländer-feindlichen Bündnis Pegida teilgenommen.
Darum fordern jetzt einige Politiker, dass der Verfassungs-Schutz die AfD überwacht.
